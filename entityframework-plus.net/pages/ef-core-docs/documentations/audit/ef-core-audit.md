# Audit

## Description

Entity Framework Core saves entities in a database but doesn't let you easily track changes, for example, a history of all modifications and their author in an audit table.

**EF+ Audit** easily tracks changes, excludes/includes entities or properties, and automatically saves audit entries in the database.


{% include template-example.html %} 
```csharp

// using Z.EntityFramework.Plus; // Don't forget to include this.

var ctx = new EntityContext();
// ... ctx changes ...

var audit = new Audit();
audit.CreatedBy = "ZZZ Projects"; // Optional
ctx.SaveChanges(audit);

// Access to all auditing information
var entries = audit.Entries;
foreach(var entry in entries)
{
    foreach(var property in entry.Properties)
    {
    }
}

```

## Limitations

  - **DO NOT** support relationships
  - **DO NOT** populate EntitySetName value

## Troubleshooting

Why only my key is added when updating my entity?

This issue often happens for MVC users. They create a new entity through HttpPost values and force the state to "Modified", the context is not aware of the original value and use the current value instead. So, every property has the original value == current value and our auditing only logs the key since all other values are equal.

We recommend setting **IgnorePropertyUnchanged** to false to log every property.

Here is an example of this issue: [Issues #8](https://github.com/zzzprojects/EntityFramework-Plus/issues/8)

## Conclusion

**Auditing** in Entity Framework Core could not be simpler, there are always some entities in an application where an audit table can be crucial to keep track of what's happening, and you now have access to an easy to use library for these situations.

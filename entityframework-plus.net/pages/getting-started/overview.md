## Batch Operations

Batch Operations methods allow you to perform **UPDATE** or **DELETE** operations directly in the database using a LINQ Query without loading entities in the context.

Everything is executed on the database side to let you get the best performance available.

## LINQ

**LINQ Dynamic** in Entity Framework is supported through the [Eval-Expression.NET](https://eval-expression.net/) Library.

## Query
### Query Cache

Query cache is the second level cache for Entity Framework.

The result of the query is returned from the cache. If the query is not cached yet, the query is materialized and cached before being returned.

### Query Deferred

Defer the execution of a query which is normally executed to allow some features like Query Cache and Query Future.

### Query Filter

Filter query with predicate at global, instance or query level.

### Query Future

Query Future allows you to reduce database roundtrips by batching multiple queries in the same sql command.

All future queries are stored in a pending list. When the first future query requires a database roundtrip, all queries are resolved in the same sql command instead of making a database roundtrip for every sql command.

### Query IncludeFilter

Entity Framework already supports eager loading. However, the major drawback is you cannot control what will be included. There is no way to load only active items or load only the first 10 comments.

### Query IncludeOptimized

Improves SQL generated by Include and filter child collections at the same time!

## Audit

Allows you to easily track changes, exclude/include entities or properties and automatically save audit entries in the database.

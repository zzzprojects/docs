# Query IncludeFilter

## Description

With Entity Framework, "Include" method is often used to load related entities / child collections. However, the method doesn't let you use LINQ queryable methods like **Where** to filter entities to include which is a major drawback. Excluding soft deleted records or limiting the result is a frequent real-life scenario which the "Include" method doesn't support.

**EF+ Query IncludeFilter** lets you filter and perform LINQ queryable methods on related entities.

{% include template-example.html %} 
```csharp

// using Z.EntityFramework.Plus; // Don't forget to include this.
var ctx = new EntitiesContext();

// LOAD orders and the first 10 active related entities.
var list = ctx.Orders.IncludeFilter(x => x.Items.Where(y => !y.IsSoftDeleted)
                                               .OrderBy(y => y.Date)
                                               .Take(10))
                     .ToList();

```

## EF+ Query IncludeFilter

IncludeFilter method works the same as "Include" method but lets you use LINQ Queryable extension methods as part of the query to filter related entities.

 - [Load one level](#load-one-level)
 - [Load multiple levels](#load-multiple-level)
 
### Load one level

{% include template-example.html %} 
```csharp

// using Z.EntityFramework.Plus; // Don't forget to include this.
var ctx = new EntitiesContext();

// LOAD blogs and related active posts.
var blogs = ctx.Blogs.IncludeFilter(x => x.Posts.Where(y => !y.IsSoftDeleted)).ToList();

```
[Try it](https://dotnetfiddle.net/10sM7d)

### Load multiple levels

{% include template-example.html %} 
```csharp

// using Z.EntityFramework.Plus; // Don't forget to include this.
var ctx = new EntitiesContext();

// LOAD blogs and related active posts and comments.
var blogs = ctx.Blogs.IncludeFilter(x => x.Posts.Where(y => !y.IsSoftDeleted))
                     .IncludeFilter(x => x.Posts.Where(y => !y.IsSoftDeleted)
                                                .Select(y => y.Comments
                                                              .Where(z => !z.IsSoftDeleted)))
                     .ToList();

```

## Real Life Scenarios

 - [Paging](#paging)
 - [Security Access](#security-access)
 - [Soft Delete](#soft-delete)
 
### Paging

Paging (Include a range of related entities)

{% include template-example.html %} 
```csharp

// using Z.EntityFramework.Plus; // Don't forget to include this.
var ctx = new EntitiesContext();

// LOAD posts and most trending comments.
var posts= ctx.Posts.IncludeFilter(x => x.Comments
                                         .OrderByDescending(y => y.ThreadingScore)
                                         .Take(10))
                     .ToList();

```
[Try it](https://dotnetfiddle.net/WpLt3A)

### Security Access

Security Access (Include available related entities)

{% include template-example.html %} 
```csharp

// myRoleID = 1; // Administrator

// using Z.EntityFramework.Plus; // Don't forget to include this.
var ctx = new EntitiesContext();

// LOAD posts and available comments for the role level.
var posts= ctx.Posts.IncludeFilter(x => x.Comments.Where(y => y.RoleID >= myRoleID))
                    .ToList();

```
[Try it](https://dotnetfiddle.net/8hXy4V)

### Soft Delete

Soft Deleted Records (Include active related entities)

{% include template-example.html %} 
```csharp

// using Z.EntityFramework.Plus; // Don't forget to include this.
var ctx = new EntitiesContext();

// LOAD posts and active comments.
var posts= ctx.Posts.IncludeFilter (x => x.Comments.Where(y => !y.IsSoftDeleted))
                    .ToList();

```
[Try it](https://dotnetfiddle.net/sGsBlh)
 
## Behind the code

### Step 1 - Custom Queryable

The first time IncludeFilter is called, a custom Queryable and Provider are created for your query and will be used to append all queries.

### Step 2 - Iterate or Execute

When an immediate method is invoked to resolve the query, the initial query is modified to create a new query which includes related entities.

 - The iterate method is invoked when it is possible to return multiple results like **ToList()** and **ToArray()**
 - The execute method is invoked when it is possible to return only one result like **First()** and **Last()**

### Original Query:

{% include template-example.html %} 
```csharp

var list = ctx.Orders.IncludeFilter(x => x.OrderItems.Where(y => !y.IsSoftDeleted))
                     .Take(10)
                     .ToList();

```

### Executed Query:

{% include template-example.html %} 
```csharp

var q1 = ctx.Orders.Take(10)
var p1 = q1.Select(x => x.OrderItems.Where(y => !y.IsSoftDeleted));

var list = q1.Select(x => new { x, p1 }).ToList().Select(x => x.X);

```

Entity Framework already does all the job by linkingÂ related entities to the parent. No future logic is required.

## Limitations

 - **DO NOT** work with **AsNoTracking**
 - Entity Framework 5:
   - Will never be supported. Use IncludeOptimized instead to filter collections
 - Cannot be mixed with projection
 - Cannot be mixed with Include (Include doesn't support projection)
 - Cannot be mixed with IncludeOptimized
 - Many to Many relationship:
   - Not supported yet
 - Relationship:
   - Entities will contain all previously loaded related entities even if the Query does not return them. It's a limitation due to how Entity Framework relationships work.

{% include template-example.html %} 
```csharp

// using Z.EntityFramework.Plus; // Don't forget to include this.
var ctx = new EntitiesContext();

ctx.Comments.ToList();

// The posts automatically contain all comments even without using the "Include" method.
ctx.Posts.ToList();

// Trying to load only one comment will obviously not work either.
ctx.Posts.IncludeFilter(q => q.Comments.Take(1)).ToList();

```

## Conclusion

Filtering included related entities is one of the most frequently asked questions in forums. **EF+ Query IncludeFilter** now makes it possible without any learning curve required for a junior developer to understand what the method does.

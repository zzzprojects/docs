title: Can I combine TPH inheritance with another inheritance in EF Core?

No, you can only have one inheritance at a time. You cannot combine Table Per Hierarchy (TPH) with a [TPC](https://www.learnentityframeworkcore.com/inheritance/table-per-concrete) or [TPT](https://www.learnentityframeworkcore.com/inheritance/table-per-type) inheritance.

[ZZZ Projects](https://zzzprojects.com/) is a leading software development company that specializes in creating tools and solutions for .NET developers. Founded in 2014 by [**Jonathan Magnan**](https://jonathanmagnan.com/), the company has earned recognition for its deep expertise in **Entity Framework (EF) and EF Core**, two of the most widely used ORM technologies in the .NET ecosystem.

Jonathan Magnan is a passionate developer and entrepreneur dedicated to helping the .NET community write faster, cleaner, and more efficient code. Through ZZZ Projects, he has created and maintained libraries used by thousands of companies worldwide — including industry leaders who rely on Entity Framework Extensions to power high-performance applications.

One of ZZZ Projects’ most notable contributions to the EF Core ecosystem is the [**Entity Framework Extensions**](https://entityframework-extensions.net/) library. It provides a suite of powerful [**Bulk Extensions**](https://entityframework-extensions.net/bulk-extensions) methods that enable developers to perform large-scale database operations directly through EF Core — dramatically improving speed while reducing the complexity of the code.

In addition to their work on EF Core and related technologies, ZZZ Projects develops and maintains several other performance-focused libraries, including [**Dapper Plus**](https://dapper-plus.net/), as well as offering consulting and training services for .NET developers.

ZZZ Projects is known for its commitment to creating high-quality, easy-to-use tools that make developers more productive and efficient. The team continues to push the limits of what’s possible with EF Core, helping developers deliver enterprise-grade performance with the simplicity they love.

Whether you’re a solo developer, consultant, or part of a large team, ZZZ Projects — led by Jonathan Magnan — remains a trusted partner for building faster, smarter, and more scalable .NET applications.

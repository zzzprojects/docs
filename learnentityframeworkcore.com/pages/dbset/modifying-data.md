# EF Core Modify Record

The approach that you adopt to modify entities via the `DbSet` depends on whether the context is currently tracking the entity being modified or not. 

In the following example, the entity is obtained by the context, so the context begins tracking it immediately. When you alter property values on a tracked entity, the context changes the `EntityState` for the entity to `Modified` and the ChangeTracker records the old property values and the new property values. When `SaveChanges` is called, an `UPDATE` statement is generated and executed by the database.

```csharp
var author = context.Authors.Find(1);
author.FirstName = "Bill";
context.SaveChanges();
```

Since the ChangeTracker tracks which properties have been modified, the context  will issue a SQL statement that updates only those properties that were changed:

```sql
exec sp_executesql N'SET NOCOUNT ON;
UPDATE [Authors] SET [FirstName] = @p0
WHERE [AuthorId] = @p1;
SELECT @@ROWCOUNT;
',N'@p1 int,@p0 nvarchar(4000)',@p1=1,@p0=N'Bill'
```

## Disconnected Scenario

In a disconnected scenario such as an ASP.NET application, changes to an existing entity's property values can take place in a controller or service method, well away from the context. In these cases, the context needs to be informed that the entity is in a modified state. This can be achieved by using the `DbSet<T>.Update` method (which is new in EF Core).

## DbSet Update

The `DbSet<T>` class provides `Update` and `UpdateRange` methods for working with an individual or multiple entities. 

```csharp
public void Save(Author author)
{
    context.Authors.Update(author);
    context.SaveChanges();
}
```
This method results in the entity being tracked by the context as `Modified`. The context doesn't have any way of identifying which property values have been changed and will generate SQL to update all properties. Any related entities (such as a collection of books in this example) will also be tracked in the `Modified` state, resulting in `UPDATE` statements being generated for each of them. If the related entity doesn't have a key value assigned, it will be marked as `Added`, and an `INSERT` statement will be generated instead.

## Updating in Bulk with Entity Framework Extensions

The standard `Update` and `UpdateRange` methods are fine for small updates, but they donâ€™t scale well when you need to modify thousands (or millions) of rows. EF Core still issues one `UPDATE` per entity, even when batching is enabled.

For true high-performance updates, you can use the [BulkUpdate](https://entityframework-extensions.net/bulk-update) method from Entity Framework Extensions.

```csharp
// Standard EF Core approach (multiple UPDATE statements)
context.Authors.UpdateRange(authors);
context.SaveChanges();

// @nuget: Z.EntityFramework.Extensions.EFCore
using Z.EntityFramework.Extensions;

// BulkUpdate (single optimized bulk operation)
context.BulkUpdate(authors);
```

With `BulkUpdate`, all rows are updated in **one efficient database operation**, making it much faster and more reliable for large-scale updates.

# Getting Started With EF Core - ASP.NET Core

This walkthrough demonstrates the minimum required to create a database using Entity Framework Core in an ASP.NET Core application and to develop basic CRUD screens. The walkthrough assumes that you have [.NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core) installed and that you have a suitable development environment/text editor. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) will be used in this example.

## Creating an ASP.NET Core application

If you have a version of Visual Studio that supports .NET Core (2015 or greater), you can use the project templates to create a new .NET Core Web application. Alternatively, you can use a command line tool to create and build the project. In this example, you will use the command line tool from within Visual Studio Code.

The first step is to create a folder for the application in a suitable location. Name the folder _EFCoreWebDemo_. Once created, open the folder in Visual Studio Code. Having done that, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>'</kbd> to open a Terminal window.

![Visual Studio Code Terminal](/images/28-02-2017-09-02-38.png)

Next, use the terminal to type these commands

```cmd
> dotnet new mvc  
> dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
> dotnet add package --version 1.1.0-msbuild3-final Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools 
> dotnet restore      
> dotnet run          
```

The commands above
- scaffolds a starter ASP.NET Core application that uses the MVC framework  
![ASP.NET Core MVC application](/images/02-03-2017-08-43-18.png)
- adds the Entity Framework Core and EF Core tooling packages from NuGet to the project
- restores all packages
- builds and runs the application 

You should get confirmation that the application is running on port 5000:

![Visual Studio Code application running on port 5000](/images/02-03-2017-08-44-08.png)

If you navigate to `http://localhost:5000` in your preferred browser, you should see the standard Microsoft MVC application running:

![ASP.NET Core application running in browser](/images/28-02-2017-09-18-40.png)

To continue with the next steps, stop the application by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>.

Open the EFCoreDemo folder in Visual Studio Code. 

Modify the _.csproj_ file to include the following section:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
    <DotNetCliToolReference
        Include="Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools.DotNet"
        Version="1.0.0-msbuild3-final" />
</ItemGroup>
```

This step is only necessary if the _.csproj_ file wasn't automatically modified to add the entry when the Tools package was installed. See [https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFramework/issues/7358](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFramework/issues/7358).

 Once you have made this amendment, you can test to see if [ef commands](/migrations/commands/cli-commands) are available to you by navigating to the project folder in a terminal/command window and typing the following command:

```cmd
dotnet ef -h
```
 
This should result in the initial help for the EF tools being displayed:

![EF commands Help](/images/02-03-2017-09-10-21.png)

## Creating the Model
Add a folder named _Model_ to the application.

Add a new file named _EFCoreWebDemoContext.cs_ to the _Model_ folder and add the following code to it:

```csharp
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;

namespace EFCoreWebDemo
{
    public class EFCoreWebDemoContext : DbContext
    {
        public DbSet<Book> Books { get; set; }
        public DbSet<Author> Authors { get; set; }

        protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder)
        {
            optionsBuilder.UseSqlServer(@"Server=.\;Database=EFCoreWebDemo;Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=true");
        }
    }
}
```

> **Note**: The model, particularly the DbContext class, is declared inside a `namespace`. If you don't place your context class in a namespace, you may come up against this [long-running open bug](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFramework/issues/2467) when adding your migration.

Next, add a new file named _Author.cs_ and add the following code to it:

```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;

namespace EFCoreWebDemo
{ 
    public class Author
    {
        public int AuthorId { get; set; }
        public string FirstName { get; set; }
        public string LastName { get; set; }
        public ICollection<Book> Books { get; set; } = new List<Book>();
    }
}
```
Finally, add a new file named _Book.cs_ and add the following code to it:
```csharp
namespace EFCoreWebDemo
{ 
    public class Book
    {
        public int BookId { get; set; }
        public string Title { get; set; }
        public int AuthorId { get; set; }
        public Author Author { get; set; }
    }
}
```

This code defines classes for two entities - `Book` and `Author` that participate in a [fully defined one-to-many relationship](/conventions/one-to-many-relationship#fully-defined-relationship). The code also includes a class named `EFCoreDemoContext` that inherits from [DbContext](/dbcontext). This class has two [DbSet](/dbset) properties that represent the tables in the database (which are yet to be created). The `EFCoreWebDemoContext` class also includes a method named `OnConfiguring` where the connection string for a SQL Server database is defined. You should change this to suit your environment and database provider.

Before moving on to the migration, type `dotnet build` to ensure that the application builds correctly. 

## Adding a Migration

[Migrations](/migrations) are used to keep the database schema in sync with the model. There is no database at the moment, so the first migration will create it and add tables for the entities represented by the `DbSet` properties on the `EFCoreDemoContext` that you added. 

Visual Studio Code doesn't provide any support (at the time of writing) for creating and executing migrations. Therefore they will be managed using the command prompt. Having opened one (if it's not still open from having created and built the application), navigate to the project folder and enter the following command:

```cmd
dotnet ef  migrations add CreateDatabase
```
A new folder named Migrations is added to the project. It contains the code for the migration and a [model snapshot](/migrations/model-snapshot).

![EF Core Migration](/images/02-03-2017-13-52-44.png)


Enter the following command to execute the migration:

```cmd
dotnet ef database update
```
The database is created but all of the string fields are unlimited in size (`nvarchar(MAX)` in SQL Server).

![Database created](/images/02-03-2017-13-57-21.png)

## Modifying the Database With Migrations

In the next section, you will modify the model to set limits to the size of selected string properties, and then use migrations to push those changes to the database schema.

Add the following to the `using` directives at the top of _Author.cs_ and _Book.cs_:
```csharp
using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;
```
Modify the `Book` and `Author` entities so that they look like this:
```csharp
public class Book
{
    public int BookId { get; set; }
    [StringLength(255)]
    public string Title { get; set; }
    public int AuthorId { get; set; }
    public Author Author { get; set; }
}
```
```csharp
public class Author
{
    public int AuthorId { get; set; }
    [StringLength(50)]
    public string FirstName { get; set; }
    [StringLength(75)]
    public string LastName { get; set; }
    public ICollection<Book> Books { get; set; } = new List<Book>();
}
```
In the Terminal, type the following command:

```cmd
dotnet ef migrations add LimitStrings
```

followed by 

```cmd
dotnet ef database update
```

This will scaffold a migration that will alter the size of the `Book`'s `Title` field and the `Author`'s `FirstName` and `LastName` fields. You should also get a warning that the scaffolded migration could lead to data loss. In this case, there is no data to be lost so the warning can be ignored.

Once the migration has been applied, the database schema will be altered. Here's how the modified `Author` table should look:

![Author Table](/images/17-02-2017-08-48-18.png)

## Working With Data

In the next section, you will create a web page for adding new authors to the database and for displaying them. Add a new file named _AuthorController.cs_ to the _Controllers_ folder. Add the following code to the newly created file:

```csharp
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;

namespace EFCoreWebDemo.Controllers
{
    public class AuthorController : Controller
    {
        public async Task<IActionResult> Index()
        {
            using (var context = new EFCoreWebDemoContext())
            {
                var model = await context.Authors.AsNoTracking().ToListAsync();
                return View(model);
            }
            
        }  

        [HttpGet]
        public IActionResult Create()
        {
            return View();
        }

        [HttpPost]
        public async Task<IActionResult> Create([Bind("FirstName, LastName")] Author author)
        {
            using (var context = new EFCoreWebDemoContext())
            {
                context.Add(author);
                await context.SaveChangesAsync();
                return RedirectToAction("Index");
            }
        }
    }
}
```
The code in the `Index` method retrieves all authors from the database and passes them to the View. The [AsNoTracking method](/dbset/querying-data#notracking-queries) is used to prevent the context from unnecessarily tracking the data because it is intended for read-only use. The `DbContext` is instantiated in a `using` block to ensure that it is disposed of properly.

The `Create` method that takes an `Author` as a parameter is responsible for adding the new author to the database. It uses the approach whereby [data is added directly to the `DbContext`](/dbcontext/adding-data), allowing the context to infer the type of data to be added to the database.

Finally, add a new folder to the _Views_ folder and name it _Author_. Add a new file to the new folder called _Index.cshtml_. Add the following code to it:

```html
@model IEnumerable<Author>
@{
    ViewBag.Title = "Authors";
}
<h1>@ViewBag.Title</h1>
<ul>
@foreach (var author in Model)
{
    <li>@author.FirstName @author.LastName</li>
}
</ul>

<div>@Html.ActionLink("New", "create")
```
Then add a new file named _Create.cshtml_ to the _Author_ folder with the following code:

```html
@model Author
@{
    ViewBag.Title = "New Author";
}

<h1>@ViewBag.Title</h1>

@using(Html.BeginForm()){
  <div class="form-group">
    @Html.LabelFor(model => model.FirstName)
    @Html.TextBoxFor(model => model.FirstName, new { @class="form-control"}) 
  </div>
  <div class="form-group">
    @Html.LabelFor(model => model.LastName)
    @Html.TextBoxFor(model => model.LastName, new { @class="form-control"}) 
  </div>
  <button type="submit" class="btn btn-default">Submit</button>
}
```
Run the application by typing the following command:

```cmd
dotnet run
```

Open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000/author/create`. You should see a data entry form similar to this:

![Data entry form](/images/2017-03-03_21-44-32.png)

Enter an author's name and submit the form. You should get redirected to the index page where a list of any authors entered so far is displayed:

![List of authors](/images/2017-03-03_21-45-50.png)

## Adding Related Data

In the next section, you will add new books to the database which will be related to an existing author.

First, add a new file to the _Controllers_ folder named _BookController.cs_. Add the following code to the new file:

```csharp
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using System.Linq;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Rendering;

namespace EFCoreWebDemo.Controllers
{
    public class BookController : Controller
    {
        public async Task<IActionResult> Index()
        {
            using (var context = new EFCoreWebDemoContext())
            {
                var model = await context.Authors.Include(a => a.Books).AsNoTracking().ToListAsync();
                return View(model);
            }
            
        }  

        [HttpGet]
        public async Task<IActionResult> Create()
        {
            using(var context = new EFCoreWebDemoContext())
            {
                var authors = await context.Authors.Select(a => new SelectListItem {
                    Value = a.AuthorId.ToString(), 
                    Text = $"{a.FirstName} {a.LastName}"
                }).ToListAsync();
                ViewBag.Authors = authors;
            }
            return View();
        }

        [HttpPost]
        public async Task<IActionResult> Create([Bind("Title, AuthorId")] Book book)
        {
            using (var context = new EFCoreWebDemoContext())
            {
                context.Books.Add(book);
                await context.SaveChangesAsync();
                return RedirectToAction("Index");
            }
        }
    }
}
```
This time, the code in the `Index` method retrieves all authors and uses the `Include` method to eagerly load the related books from the database and pass them to the View. Again, the [AsNoTracking method](/dbset/querying-data#notracking-queries) is used. The authors and their books are only being used for display. 

In the first `Create` method, each of the authors is retrieved from the database and [projected into a new form](/dbset/querying-data#returning-non-entity-types) - a `SelectListItem`. Non-entity types are not tracked by the context which is why the `AsNoTracking` method is not used in this case, despite the fact that the data is for read-only use.

The second `Create` method features an example of the entity being added to its `DbSet`, rather than the `DbContext` as was the case for the author.

Next, add a new folder to the _Views_ folder named _Book_. Add a new file to the _Book_ folder named _Index.cshtml_ and copy the following code into it:

```html
@model IEnumerable<Author>
@{
    ViewBag.Title = "Authors and their books";
}
<h1>@ViewBag.Title</h1>
@if(Model.Any()){
    <ul>
    @foreach(var author in Model){
        <li>@author.FirstName @author.LastName
            <ul>
            @foreach(var book in author.Books){
                <li>@book.Title</li>
            }
            </ul>
        </li>
    }
    </ul>
}
<div>@Html.ActionLink("New", "create")
```

Finally, add another file to the _Views/Book_ folder named _Create.cshtml_ and add the following code to it:

```html
@model Book
@{
    ViewBag.Title = "New Book";
}

<h1>@ViewBag.Title</h1>

@using(Html.BeginForm()){
  <div class="form-group">
    @Html.LabelFor(model => model.AuthorId)
    @Html.DropDownListFor(model => model.AuthorId, (IEnumerable<SelectListItem>)ViewBag.Authors, string.Empty, new { @class="form-control"}) 
  </div>
  <div class="form-group">
    @Html.LabelFor(model => model.Title)
    @Html.TextBoxFor(model => model.Title, new { @class="form-control"}) 
  </div>
  <button type="submit" class="btn btn-default">Submit</button>
}
```
Execute the `dotnet run` command to build and run the application. You might need to press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> to stop the application first. Once it is running again, navigate to `http://localhost:5000/book/create` where you should see a data entry screen like this:

![Add new book](/images/2017-03-04_20-41-36.png)

The AuthorId dropdown should be populated with the authors that you have so far entered into the application. Select one and enter a book title and hit the submit button. You should then be redirected to the Index view which will display a list of all authors and their books.

![Authors and their books](/images/2017-03-04_20-46-42.png)

# ðŸ§© EF Core Bulk Merge / Upsert with Entity Framework Extensions

The `BulkMerge` method from [Entity Framework Extensions](https://entityframework-extensions.net/bulk-merge) is an `UPSERT` operation that combines both **insert** and **update** into a single, efficient database call.

- If the data **exists**, it will be updated.  
- If the data **doesnâ€™t exist**, it will be inserted.

This operation is often also called **upsert**, **add or update**, or **insert or update**.

```csharp
// @nuget: Z.EntityFramework.Extensions.EFCore
using Z.EntityFramework.Extensions;

var customers = new List<Customer>
{
    new Customer { Name = "ZZZ Projects", City = "New York" },
    new Customer { Name = "Jonathan Magnan", City = "Montreal" }
    // Add more customers as needed
};

using (var context = new YourDbContext())
{
    // Easy to use
    context.BulkMerge(customers);
    
    // Easy to customize
    context.BulkMerge(customers, options => options.IncludeGraph = true);
}

using (var context = new YourDbContext())
{
    // Supports async
    await context.BulkMergeAsync(customers);
}

## ðŸš€ Why Use the Bulk Merge Method from Entity Framework Extensions?

The `BulkMerge` method is the recommended solution when you need to perform an `add or update` operation. **Bulk merging with Entity Framework Extensions is up to 5x faster**, reducing execution time by **80%** ([Online Benchmark](https://dotnetfiddle.net/hmDtiI)).

It also comes with several other advantages:

âœ… **Add or update the way you want:** Define custom keys, control which properties to insert or update, and apply conditions.
âœ… **Extremely fast:** Handle thousands or even millions of upserts in seconds. See the [Performance Comparison](https://entityframework-extensions.net/bulk-merge#performance-comparison).
âœ… **No need to load entities:** Save memory and time by working directly with your data â€” no tracking required.
âœ… **Flexible with hundreds of options:** Customize the behavior to match your business rules â€” from conditional updates to advanced key matching. Explore the full list of [Bulk Merge Options](https://entityframework-extensions.net/bulk-merge#bulk-merge-options).

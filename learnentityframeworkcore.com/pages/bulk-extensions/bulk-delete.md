# üóëÔ∏è EF Core Bulk Delete with Entity Framework Extensions

EF Core provides the `Remove` and `RemoveRange` methods for deleting entities. However, they may not be the best option when deleting large amounts of data from a database.

The **fastest and easiest** way to delete multiple entities is by using the [Bulk Delete Extensions Method from Entity Framework Extensions](https://entityframework-extensions.net/bulk-delete), a third-party library built for EF Core. Imagine needing to delete 100,000 inactive customers ‚Äî `BulkDelete` handles it in seconds.

This library, created by [ZZZ Projects](https://zzzprojects.com/), is extremely fast and offers hundreds of features ‚Äî including all other bulk operations ‚Äî to handle both common and complex scenarios.

To use the **Bulk Extensions Methods**, simply install the [Z.EntityFramework.Extensions.EFCore](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Z.EntityFramework.Extensions.EFCore/) NuGet package in your project and call the `BulkDelete` method from your `DbContext`.

```csharp
// @nuget: Z.EntityFramework.Extensions.EFCore
using Z.EntityFramework.Extensions;

var customers = new List<Customer>
{
	new Customer { Name = "ZZZ Projects", City = "New York" },
	new Customer { Name = "Jonathan Magnan", City = "Montreal" }
	// Add more customers as needed
};

using (var context = new YourDbContext())
{
    // Easy to use
    context.BulkDelete(customers);
    
    // Easy to customize
    context.BulkDelete(customers, options => options.BatchSize = 100);
}

using (var context = new YourDbContext())
{
    // Supports async
    await context.BulkDeleteAsync(customers);
}

## üöÄ Why Use the Bulk Delete Method from Entity Framework Extensions?

Deleting entities with EF Core is already fast.
But **bulk deleting with Entity Framework Extensions is up to 3x faster**, reducing execution time by **65%** ([Online Benchmark](https://dotnetfiddle.net/zzMQgZ)).

It also comes with several other advantages:

* ‚úÖ **Delete the way you want** ‚Äì Use custom keys, delete related entities (graph), or target specific conditions.
* ‚úÖ **Extremely fast** ‚Äì Delete thousands or even millions of rows in just seconds. See the [Performance Comparison](https://entityframework-extensions.net/bulk-delete#performance-comparison).
* ‚úÖ **No need to load entities** ‚Äì Avoid change tracking and delete directly from the database.
* ‚úÖ **Flexible with hundreds of options** ‚Äì Choose how relationships are handled, how keys are matched, and much more. Explore the [Bulk Delete Options](https://entityframework-extensions.net/bulk-delete#bulk-delete-options).

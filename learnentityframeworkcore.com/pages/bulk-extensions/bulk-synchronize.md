# EF Core Bulk Synchronize with Entity Framework Extensions

[Entity Framework Extensions](https://entityframework-extensions.net/) provides the `BulkSynchronize` extension method, which allows you to perform bulk inserts, updates, and deletes in a single operation.

- âœ… It reduces the need for writing multiple separate queries.
- âœ… It improves performance by batching commands to minimize database round-trips.
- âœ… It supports advanced features like conditional synchronization for more control over how data is merged.

Using `BulkSynchronize` is simple. Just pass your list of entities and let the library handle the rest. Properties will be automatically mapped to matching column names.

Hereâ€™s an example of how to use the `BulkSynchronize` method with EF Core:

```csharp
// @nuget: Z.EntityFramework.Extensions.EFCore
using Z.EntityFramework.Extensions;

var customers = new List<Customer>
{
    new Customer { Name = "ZZZ Projects", City = "New York" },
    new Customer { Name = "Jonathan Magnan", City = "Montreal" }
    // Add more customers as needed
};

using (var context = new YourDbContext())
{
    // Easy to use
    context.BulkSynchronize(customers);

    // Easy to customize
    context.BulkSynchronize(customers, options => options.IncludeGraph = true);
}

using (var context = new YourDbContext())
{
    // Supports async
    await context.BulkSynchronizeAsync(customers);
}
````

Bulk synchronization is especially useful when you need to keep two datasets in sync or handle large-scale data operations efficiently.
Instead of inserting, updating, and deleting entities one by one, everything is handled in a single, optimized batch.

The **easiest and fastest way** to synchronize data with EF Core is by using the [Entity Framework Extensions](https://entityframework-extensions.net/) library from ZZZ Projects.

## ðŸš€ Why Use the Bulk Synchronize Method from Entity Framework Extensions?

The `BulkSynchronize` method is a smart choice when you want to keep data consistent and improve performance by reducing round-trips to the database.

Here are a few reasons to use it:

* âœ… Ensures **data consistency** by executing all operations in a single transaction
* âœ… **Much faster** than performing separate insert, update, and delete operations
* âœ… Ideal for large-scale operations such as **data migrations** or **data sync between systems**
* âœ… Supports advanced features like **custom keys** and **conditional sync logic**

## ðŸ“¦ How to Install Entity Framework Extensions

To use the `BulkSynchronize` method, install the [Z.EntityFramework.Extensions.EFCore NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Z.EntityFramework.Extensions.EFCore/):

```powershell
PM> NuGet\Install-Package Z.EntityFramework.Extensions.EFCore
```

```bash
> dotnet add package Z.EntityFramework.Extensions.EFCore
```

Make sure the **first digit** of the version matches your EF Core version.
For example, if you're using `EF Core 9`, use version `v9.x.y.z` of the package.

title: EF Core Bulk Synchronize
description: The BulkSynchronize method in Entity Framework Extensions is a powerful and highly efficient way to perform bulk updates of entities within the database. It enables you to easily sync multiple records with the same data while avoiding tedious loops where one record needs to be updated at a time.

# EF Core Bulk Synchronize

Bulk synchronization is a process of transferring large amounts of data from one database to another in a single batch, as opposed to updating them incrementally. The goal is to improve the efficiency and speed of data transfer and to minimize the impact on the source database.

The **easiest and fastest way** to synchronize data is by using the [Entity Framework Extensions](https://entityframework-extensions.net/) third-party library.

## Bulk Extensions Synchronize

[Entity Framework Extensions](https://entityframework-extensions.net/) provides the `BulkSynchronize` extension method that allows you to perform bulk inserts, updates, and deletes into the database in a single operation. 

 - It can reduce the complexity of writing multiple queries and adds an extra layer of performance optimization. 
 - It also supports batching which helps minimize round trips to the database by grouping commands together. 
 - Additionally, it provides helpful features such as conditional synchronization, making it easier to create custom logic for merging data. 

Using the `BulkSynchronize` method is very simple. All you need to do is pass your entities in the parameter and let the auto-mapping match properties to column names:

Here's an example of how to use the `BulkSynchronize` method in Entity Framework Core:

```csharp
using (var context = new MyDbContext())
{
    // Create a list of entities to be synchronized
    var authors = new List<Author>
    {
        new Author { Id = 1, Name = "John" },
        new Author { Id = 2, Name = "Jane" },
        new Author { Id = 3, Name = "Jim" }
    };

    // Use the BulkSynchronize method to synchronize the entities into the database
    context.BulkSynchronize(authors);
}
```

## Why You Should Use BulkSynchronize

The bulk synchronize operation allows you to perform multiple data operations at once, reducing the number of round trips to the database and improving performance. You might consider using the `BulkSynchronize` method in Entity Framework Core for several reasons:

 - The bulk synchronize operation is designed to ensure data consistency by using a single transaction to perform all the operations, eliminating the risk of data inconsistencies caused by multiple, separate transactions. 
 - The bulk synchronize can be much faster than executing separate insert, delete, and update operations. 
 - This feature is useful when you need to perform large-scale data operations, such as data migrations, and want to improve performance and reduce the risk of data inconsistencies.

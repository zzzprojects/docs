# EF Core Bulk Insert with Entity Framework Extensions

The `BulkInsert` extension method is part of the [Entity Framework Extensions](https://entityframework-extensions.net/) library.  
It lets you insert a large number of entities into your database in a single operationâ€”dramatically reducing the number of round-trips and improving performance.

```csharp
// @nuget: Z.EntityFramework.Extensions.EFCore
using Z.EntityFramework.Extensions;

var customers = new List<Customer>
{
    new Customer { Name = "ZZZ Projects", City = "New York" },
    new Customer { Name = "Jonathan Magnan", City = "Montreal" }
    // Add more customers as needed
};

using (var context = new YourDbContext())
{
    // Easy to use
    context.BulkInsert(customers);
    
    // Easy to customize
    context.BulkInsert(customers, options => options.IncludeGraph = true);
}

using (var context = new YourDbContext())
{
    // Supports async
    await context.BulkInsertAsync(customers);
}
````

In this example, we create a list of `Customer` objects and insert them all at once using the `BulkInsert` method.
The operation is simple, efficient, and supports many customization options.

The `BulkInsert` method works directly with your `DbContext` or `DbSet`, and under the hood, it uses the best available bulk insert mechanism for your database providerâ€”like `SqlBulkCopy` for SQL Server.

You can also fine-tune the behavior with options like:

* âœ… Setting a batch size to control how many rows are inserted per round-trip
* âœ… Mapping properties to columns
* âœ… Customizing timeout, transactions, and more

The method is perfect when working with large datasets or during data migration.

## ðŸ“¦ How to Install Entity Framework Extensions

To use the `BulkInsert` method, install the [Z.EntityFramework.Extensions.EFCore NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Z.EntityFramework.Extensions.EFCore/):

```powershell
PM> NuGet\Install-Package Z.EntityFramework.Extensions.EFCore
```

```bash
> dotnet add package Z.EntityFramework.Extensions.EFCore
```

Make sure the **first digit** of the version matches your EF Core version.
For example, if you're using `EF Core 9`, use version `v9.x.y.z` of the package.

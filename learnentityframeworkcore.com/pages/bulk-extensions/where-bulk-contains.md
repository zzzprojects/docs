# EF Core WhereBulkContains with Entity Framework Extensions

The EF Core [`WhereBulkContains`](https://entityframework-extensions.net/where-bulk-contains) extension method from Entity Framework Extensions allows you to filter a LINQ query by including all items from an existing list.

For example, imagine you have a list of `Customer` objects with the `CustomerID` and a few other properties already populated. You want to retrieve those customers from the database to update their values.

The `WhereBulkContains` method lets you filter entities based on whatâ€™s in your list.

```csharp
// @nuget: Z.EntityFramework.Extensions.EFCore
using Z.EntityFramework.Extensions;

var dictDeserializedCustomers = deserializedCustomers.ToDictionary(x => x.CustomerID);

using (var context = new EntityContext())
{
    var customers = context.Customers.WhereBulkContains(deserializedCustomers).ToList();

    customers.ForEach(x =>
    {
        var deserializedCustomer = dictDeserializedCustomers[x.CustomerID];

        x.Code = deserializedCustomer.Code;
        x.Email = deserializedCustomer.Email;
        x.FirstName = deserializedCustomer.FirstName;
        x.LastName = deserializedCustomer.LastName;
    });

    context.BulkSaveChanges();
}
````

## ðŸš€ Why Use the WhereBulkContains Method from Entity Framework Extensions?

EF Core already lets you filter your database using the LINQ `Where` + `Contains` method.
However, this method has some limitationsâ€”for example, it only works well with basic ID lists.

The `WhereBulkContains` method removes those limitations and lets you use any kind of data source:

* âœ… Basic types like `List<int>` and `List<Guid>`
* âœ… Entity types like `List<Customer>`
* âœ… Anonymous types
* âœ… ExpandoObject lists

It also comes with additional advantages over the regular `Where` + `Contains` method:

* âœ… Supports an unlimited number of items
* âœ… Supports surrogate keys

## ðŸ“¦ How to Install Entity Framework Extensions

To use the `WhereBulkContains` extension method, install the [Z.EntityFramework.Extensions.EFCore NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Z.EntityFramework.Extensions.EFCore/):

```powershell
PM> NuGet\Install-Package Z.EntityFramework.Extensions.EFCore
```

```bash
> dotnet add package Z.EntityFramework.Extensions.EFCore
```

Make sure the **first digit** of the version matches your EF Core version.
For example, if you're using `EF Core 9`, use version `v9.x.y.z` of the package.

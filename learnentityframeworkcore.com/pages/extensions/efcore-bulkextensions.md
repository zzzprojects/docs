# EFCore.BulkExtensions

> **TL;DR:** EFCore.BulkExtensions was once a great library for bulk operations in EF Core ‚Äî but it‚Äôs no longer actively maintained or commercially viable. Use the [**MIT fork**](/extensions/efcore-bulkextensions-mit) for free projects, or [**Entity Framework Extensions**](/extensions/entity-framework-extensions) for professional performance and long-term support.


The [EFCore.BulkExtensions](https://github.com/borisdj/EFCore.BulkExtensions) library was once a popular choice for performing **Bulk Inserts, Updates, Deletes, and InsertOrUpdate (upsert)** operations in Entity Framework Core (EF Core). It gained attention for being easy to use and completely free ‚Äî making it one of the most downloaded bulk operation libraries for EF Core.

But why are we talking in the past tense?

Because everything changed in early **2023**, when the project adopted a new [dual-license model](https://github.com/borisdj/EFCore.BulkExtensions/issues/1079).

Since then, **commercial use has been restricted** to companies with **less than $1M in annual revenue**.

As a result, the official EFCore.BulkExtensions package is **no longer recommended**, even for non-commercial projects, because the library is **no longer actively supported** ‚Äî aside from occasionally updating the **README.md** file ‚Äî and most support requests **remain unanswered**.

Today, developers typically choose between two better options:

* üß© **[EFCore.BulkExtensions.MIT](https://github.com/videokojot/EFCore.BulkExtensions.MIT)** ‚Äî a community-maintained fork with active support that remains fully open-source and free to use.
* üöÄ **[Entity Framework Extensions](https://entityframework-extensions.net/)** ‚Äî a professional solution offering faster performance, more features, and long-term commercial support.

üí° **In short:** use **EFCore.BulkExtensions.MIT** if you need a reliable, free, and open-source option ‚Äî or **Entity Framework Extensions** if you want professional-grade performance and support.

## Code Examples

```csharp
context.BulkInsert(customers);
context.BulkInsert(customers, options => { options.IncludeGraph = true; });
context.BulkUpdate(customers);
context.BulkInsertOrUpdate(customers);
```
---

## Key Highlights

### ‚úÖ Pros

* ‚ö° **Faster than `SaveChanges()`** for simple, flat operations
* üß© **Easy to integrate** ‚Äî works with existing EF Core entities and configurations
* üóÑÔ∏è **Database agnostic** ‚Äî supports multiple database providers
* üí° **Free for personal and companies earning less than 1M/year**

### ‚ùå Cons

* ‚ö†Ô∏è **Commercial restrictions** ‚Äî companies earning over **$1M/year** must purchase a license
* üí∏ **Subscription-based** ‚Äî requires annual renewals (not perpetual)
* üê¢ **Performance drops sharply** ‚Äî when using a few entities or `IncludeGraph` with too much entities
* üí§ **Not actively maintained** ‚Äî minimal GitHub activity and no issue responses
* üö´ **No longer competitive** ‚Äî the [MIT fork](/extensions/efcore-bulkextensions-mit) offers the same functionality for free
* ‚öñÔ∏è **Similar price to [Entity Framework Extensions](/extensions/entity-framework-extensions)**, yet offers only a fraction of the performance and features

## üß™ Benchmarks ‚Äì EFCore.BulkExtensions vs EF Core

For benchmarking purposes, we compared the **MIT fork** of EFCore.BulkExtensions (since the official package now requires a paid commercial license for us) against **pure EF Core** using `SaveChanges()` with **SQL Server** as the database provider.

The results are straightforward and easy to interpret:

* ‚úÖ **Much faster than `SaveChanges()`** for simple **Insert**, **Update**, or **InsertOrUpdate** operations when working with **large datasets**
* ‚ö†Ô∏è **Slightly slower than `SaveChanges()`** when processing a **small number of entities**, due to the fixed initialization overhead
* ‚ùå **Up to 10x slower than `SaveChanges()`** when using **`IncludeGraph`** with **around 10,000 entities or more**, making this option **effectively unusable** for performance-focused scenarios

This last point is especially important ‚Äî the **`IncludeGraph` feature** performs well on smaller graphs but suffers a major performance drop with **very large datasets** due to memory usage.

You can review or reproduce these benchmark tests directly in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/zzzprojects/learnentityframeworkcore/tree/main/benchmarks/EFCore.BulkExtensions.MIT).

### Bulk Insert (with Graph)

> This is not a mistake ‚Äî EFCore.BulkExtensions `BulkInsert` was indeed more than 10x slower than `SaveChanges()` for 100k entities.

## ‚ùì FAQ

### Is EFCore.BulkExtensions free to use commercially?

No.

It‚Äôs **not free for commercial projects** if your company earns more than **$1M in annual revenue**.

This restriction excludes most professional development teams, SaaS companies, and enterprises from using it for free.

If your organization exceeds that limit, you‚Äôll need to **[purchase a commercial license](https://codis.tech/efcorebulk)**.

---

### Is the license perpetual or subscription-based?

The EFCore.BulkExtensions license is **subscription-based**, meaning you must **renew it every year** to continue using it.

Unfortunately, this is the **worst kind of license model** ‚Äî once you purchase it, you‚Äôll need to renew it **year after year**, even if you‚Äôre no longer actively developing the project.

This approach adds **recurring costs and extra management overhead**.

üí° **In comparison:**
[**Entity Framework Extensions**](/extensions/entity-framework-extensions#is-the-license-perpetual-or-subscription-based) offers **perpetual licenses**, which you pay **only once** and can use **forever** ‚Äî no annual renewals required.

---

### What‚Äôs the difference between EFCore.BulkExtensions and Entity Framework Extensions?

That‚Äôs like asking the difference between a **Lada** and a **Lamborghini**.

**Entity Framework Extensions** simply **offers more of everything** ‚Äî from features to performance, stability, support, and even pricing.

What **Entity Framework Extensions** offers:

* üí° Offers a **perpetual license** (no forced renewals)
* ‚öôÔ∏è Provides **far more features, customization options, and integrations**
* üß© Is **actively supported** and **regularly updated**
* ‚ö° Delivers **better performance across all scenarios**
* üèÜ Backed by a **professional team** ensuring long-term reliability
* üí∏ Priced **about the same to purchase**, yet **cheaper to renew** if you choose ongoing support

---

### Is EFCore.BulkExtensions faster than `SaveChanges()`?

Yes ‚Äî for **simple bulk operations**, EFCore.BulkExtensions is **significantly faster** than `SaveChanges()`.
By batching operations and reducing database round-trips, it can handle large inserts or updates **much more efficiently** than EF Core‚Äôs default behavior.

However, there are two important exceptions to keep in mind:

* When processing a **small number of entities**, `SaveChanges()` is actually **faster**, since the setup overhead of bulk operations outweighs the benefits.
* When using **`IncludeGraph`** with **around 10,000 entities or more**, performance **drops sharply** ‚Äî in our tests, it was **over 10x slower** than `SaveChanges()`. This issue only appears with **very large graphs**.

In short, EFCore.BulkExtensions is a great choice for **flat, large-scale bulk operations**, but it‚Äôs not recommended for **small batches** or **complex graphs involving many related entities**.

---

### Which EF Core versions are supported?

EFCore.BulkExtensions currently supports **EF Core 8** and **EF Core 9**.

All previous versions ‚Äî from **EF Core 2 to 7** ‚Äî are **no longer supported or maintained**.

At the moment, there‚Äôs also **no clear roadmap** or communication about how long support will continue for the latest EF Core versions, leaving long-term compatibility uncertain.

---

### Does EFCore.BulkExtensions support all databases?

EFCore.BulkExtensions **supports multiple databases**, including:

* SQL Server
* PostgreSQL
* MySQL
* Oracle
* SQLite

However, **some features only work reliably with SQL Server**.

Other providers often have **limited functionality, missing features, or compatibility issues**, especially with advanced options.

---

### Is EFCore.BulkExtensions still maintained?

No ‚Äî **the library is effectively unmaintained** and has shown **no real activity for months**.

Aside from an occasional update to the **README file**, there‚Äôs been **no code changes, fixes, or responses to issues**.

This makes it **risky to rely on for production projects**, especially since open issues remain unanswered for long periods.

You can see this for yourself by visiting the [recent issues](https://github.com/borisdj/EFCore.BulkExtensions/issues) page on GitHub.

---

## üß≠ Summary

EFCore.BulkExtensions played an important role in bringing **free bulk operations** to the EF Core ecosystem ‚Äî but its time has passed.

With a **restricted commercial license** and **no maintenance**, it‚Äôs now **hard to recommend** the official package for modern development.

**In short:**

* üß© Choose the [**MIT fork**](https://github.com/videokojot/EFCore.BulkExtensions.MIT) for a **free, open-source** alternative that remains community-driven.
* üöÄ Choose [**Entity Framework Extensions**](https://entityframework-extensions.net/) for **professional-grade performance, more features, and long-term support**.

No matter your choice, the **official EFCore.BulkExtensions package is best avoided** in new or production projects.

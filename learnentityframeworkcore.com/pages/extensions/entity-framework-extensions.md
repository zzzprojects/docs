# Entity Framework Extensions

> **TL;DR:** Entity Framework Extensions is the recommended library for professionals who need the fastest performance, reliable support, and complete documentation.

[Entity Framework Extensions](https://entityframework-extensions.net/) is the most downloaded library for developers looking for high-performance bulk operations backed by professional support ‚Äî with **over 55 million downloads** worldwide.

Developed and maintained by [ZZZ Projects](https://zzzprojects.com/) ‚Äî a leading .NET software company since 2014 ‚Äî this library, often called **"EF Extensions"** or **"EFE"**, includes **hundreds of features**, **monthly updates**, and **dedicated support** through GitHub and email.

It supports all major versions of Entity Framework, including **EF6** and **EF Core 2 to EF Core 9**, with continuous updates to ensure compatibility.

Trusted by **thousands of .NET developers worldwide**, it has become the go-to choice for teams that need both **speed** and **reliability**.

You can explore the [professional documentation](https://entityframework-extensions.net/bulk-extensions) to learn more about bulk operations and discover advanced use cases.

---

## Code Examples

You can use **Entity Framework Extensions (EFE)** to perform all your bulk operations with just a few lines of code.

Here‚Äôs a quick overview showing how simple and powerful it is:

```csharp
// @nuget: Z.EntityFramework.Extensions.EFCore
using Z.EntityFramework.Extensions;

// --- Saving Operations ---
context.BulkInsert(customers); // Fast insert
context.BulkInsert(customers, options => { options.IncludeGraph = true; }); // Insert with related entities
context.BulkUpdate(customers); // Fast update
context.BulkDelete(customers); // Fast delete
context.BulkMerge(customers);  // Insert or update (Upsert)
context.BulkSynchronize(customers); // Keep table in sync with your data
context.BulkSaveChanges(); // Replace SaveChanges() with a faster version

// --- Retrieval Operations ---
context.Customers.BulkRead(deserializedCustomers); // Retrieve entities using a filtered query
context.Customers.WhereBulkContains(deserializedCustomers).ToList(); // Filter the query to include matching items
context.Customers.WhereBulkNotContains(deserializedCustomers).ToList(); // Filter the query to exclude matching items
context.Customers.WhereBulkContainsFilterList(deserializedCustomers).ToList(); // Return entities from the list that exist in the database
context.Customers.WhereBulkNotContainsFilterList(deserializedCustomers).ToList(); // Return entities from the list that don't exist in the database
```

These methods work seamlessly with your existing `DbContext` ‚Äî no special setup required.

You can start small with one operation and easily extend it as your project grows.

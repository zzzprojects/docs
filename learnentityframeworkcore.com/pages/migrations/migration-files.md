# EF Core Migration Files

<div class="image-outer"><img src="/images/efcore/migrations/migration-files/thumbnail-ef-core-migration-files.png" loading="lazy" alt="EF Core Migration Files"></div>

When using the [Add-Migration](/migrations/add-migration) command in EF Core, it generates three key files:

1. **[Timestamp]_[MigrationName].cs**: The primary migration file with the `Up()` and `Down()` methods. The `Up()` method has the code for when a migration is applied, and the `Down()` method has the code for when a migration is reverted.
2. **[Timestamp]_[MigrationName].Designer.cs**: A [snapshot of your model](/migrations/model-snapshot) made using a [fluent-api](/configuration/fluent-api).
3. **[ContextClassName]ModelSnapshot.cs**: The latest [snapshot of your current model](/migrations/model-snapshot). The code is the same as the latest `[Timestamp]_[MigrationName].Designer.cs` produced. This file is made only during the initial migration and updated for every following migration.

The `[Timestamp]` element is derived from the date and time when the migration is created, serving as a unique identifier for that specific migration instance.

This article will focus on the **[Timestamp]_[MigrationName].cs** file. You can view this [Model Snapshot](/migrations/model-snapshot) article to learn more about the snapshot generated by EF Core.

**Changes Made**:
- Changed "utilizing" to "using" for simpler vocabulary.
- Changed "concerned about" to "focus on" for clearer meaning.
- Made minor changes for clarity without rephrasing the overall content.

## Main Migration File

The main migration file typically contains the two principal methods:

- [Up Method](#up-method): Contains changes to be made to the database when applying a migration.
- [Down Method](#down-method): Contains changes for when you need to undo or revert a migration.

Actions associated with this file:
- **Added**: By the [Add Migration](/migrations/add-migration) command.
- **Removed**: Via the [Remove Migration](/migrations/remove-migration) command.
- **Executed**: Through the [Update Database](/migrations/update-database) command.

Below is an example showcasing the contents of this file:

```csharp
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Migrations;

#nullable disable

namespace Z.MyProjectName.MyMigrationDirectoryName
{
    /// <inheritdoc />
    public partial class AddColumn : Migration
    {
        /// <inheritdoc />
        protected override void Up(MigrationBuilder migrationBuilder)
        {
            migrationBuilder.AddColumn<string>(
                name: "Name",
                table: "Customers",
                type: "nvarchar(255)",
                nullable: false,
                defaultValue: "");
        }

        /// <inheritdoc />
        protected override void Down(MigrationBuilder migrationBuilder)
        {
            migrationBuilder.DropColumn(
                name: "Name",
                table: "Customers");
        }
    }
}
```

In the example above, a `Name` property has been added to the `Customer` entity:

- **Up Method**: The `Up` method contains the code to add a new column named `Name` of type `nvarchar(255)` to the 'Customers' table.
- **Down Method**: The `Down` method contains the code to undo the actions of the `Up` method, essentially removing the `Name` column from the 'Customers' table. 

## Up Method

The `Up` method contains instructions to apply the desired changes, transitioning the database to a newer state.

For instance, consider a `Name` property has been added to the `Customer` entity. When using the [Add-Migration](/migrations/add-migration) command, a new migration file will be created with the `Up` method that would encapsulate the code to introduce this new column to the database. Here is an example of what the `Up` method could contain:

```csharp
protected override void Up(MigrationBuilder migrationBuilder)
{
	migrationBuilder.AddColumn<string>(
		name: "Name",
		table: "Customers",
		type: "nvarchar(255)",
		nullable: false,
		defaultValue: "");
}
``` 

In this example, the `AddColumn` method specifies the addition of a "Name" column to the "Customers" table. The new column is of `string` type, cannot be null, and has a maximum length of 255 characters.

## Down Method

The `Down` method contains instructions to reverse the actions of the `Up` method, reverting the database back to its previous state.

For instance, referring back to our previous example where the `Name` property was added, to revert this change, we would need to remove the column from our database. Here is an example of what the `Down` method could contain:

```csharp
protected override void Down(MigrationBuilder migrationBuilder)
{
	migrationBuilder.DropColumn(
		name: "Name",
		table: "Customers");
}
```

In this example, the `DropColumn` method indicates that the "Name" column will be removed from the "Customers" table.

### Provider Specific Methods

#### MySQL Methods (MySql.Data.EntityFrameworkCore)

Unfortunately, the code for [MySql.Data.EntityFrameworkCore](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MySql.Data.EntityFrameworkCore) isn't open source. We couldn't find the source of `MySql` extensions for migration when decompiling the DLL.

However, several sources mention two specific extensions for migrations. These were discovered in the `MySQLMigrationsSqlGenerator.cs` file when decompiling and are also referenced in the [MySQL Connector](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-net/en/connector-net-ref-efcore.html) documentation.

- `IsMySql`: Returns `true` if the active provider for the migration is `MySQL`.
- `CharSet`: Determines the charset for an entity property.
- `Collation`: Determines the collation for an entity property.

#### MySQL Methods (Pomelo.EntityFrameworkCore.MySql)

You can find specific [Pomelo.EntityFrameworkCore.MySql](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Pomelo.EntityFrameworkCore.MySql) extensions for migration in the [MySqlMigrationBuilderExtensions.cs](https://github.com/PomeloFoundation/Pomelo.EntityFrameworkCore.MySql/blob/master/src/EFCore.MySql/Extensions/MySqlMigrationBuilderExtensions.cs) file on GitHub. As of **2023**, it has the following methods:

- **IsMySql**: Returns `true` if the active provider for the migration is `MySQL`.
- **DropPrimaryKey**: Removes a specific primary key for a table.
- **DropUniqueConstraint**: Removes a specific unique constraint for a table.

#### PostgreSQL Methods

# PreventAllDisabledFilterConditions

## Description

Prevent the inclusion of conditions in the sql query used to enable/disable filters. This will completely prevent the ability to enable & disable filters globally throughout the application.

If you never require the need to enable or disable filters at any time during the application lifecycle, you can prevent this condition entirely.


```csharp

// disable a single filter
modelBuilder.PreventDisabledFilterConditions("IsDeleted");

// disable all filters defined up to calling this method
modelBuilder.PreventAllDisabledFilterConditions();

```

 - Once this is set, it cannot be undone because EF only gives us 1 shot at including those conditions.
 - It will apply to all filters defined at the time this method is called.  
 - So to apply to all filters, call this after they have all been defined.

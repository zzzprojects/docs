# SQL Server Compact Provider

## Description
You can use SqlServer Compact by adding a reference to the provider package.

NuGet: https://www.nuget.org/packages/Z.EntityFramework.Classic.SqlServerCompact/

[Try it](https://dotnetfiddle.net/aw6MDk)

## Limitations

### NET Standard
Since there is no .NET Standard version for Microsoft.SqlServer.Compact, it's currently impossible for us to support it. When Microsoft begins to support it, we will do the same.

# AlsoInclude

## Description
You can chain multiple related objects to the query result by using the `AlsoInclude` and `ThenInclude` methods. The `AlsoInclude` method doesn't move the chaining level. It allows to include multiple related objects from the same level.

`AlsoInclude` is a syntactic sugar method to make it easier and clearer to include multiple related objects.

```csharp
ctx.OrderDetails
    .Include(orderDetail => orderDetail.Product)
        .AlsoInclude(product => product.Category)
        .AlsoInclude(product => product.Supplier)
    .ToList();
```

### Note
- If you want to reset the level to the root, use [`Include`](include.md)
- If you want to include items from the next level, use [`ThenInclude`](then-include.md)

## Limitations

### DbQuery
Chaining includes only work if the first include call is from a `DbQuery`. If you used some LINQ and the query is currently an `IQueryable`, you can use the method `AsDbQuery` to tell the compiler that's a `DbQuery`.
This restriction is currently required to avoid some side impact with queries that are not directly using the `DbQuery` class.

```csharp
ctx.OrderDetails
    .Where(orderDetail => orderDetail.Quantity > 1)
    .AsDbQuery()
    .Include(orderDetail => orderDetail.Product)
        .AlsoInclude(product => product.Category)
        .AlsoInclude(product => product.Supplier)
    .ToList();
```

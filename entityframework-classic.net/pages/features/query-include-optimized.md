# Query Include Optimized

## Description

The **EF Query Include Optimized** feature lets you filter related entities that will be included. However, instead of making one big query like **Query Include Filter**, the queries are split into several queries to optimize the performance like `EF Core` does.

The feature works exactly like [Query Include Filter](/query-include-filter), but you use the `IncludeOptimized` method instead.

The query is split in multiple queries which reduce the amount of data transferred.

```csharp
var customers = context.Customers.IncludeOptimized(x => x.Invoices.Where(y => !y.IsSoftDeleted)).ToList();
```
Try it: [NET Core](https://dotnetfiddle.net/SyGPU2) | [NET Framework](https://dotnetfiddle.net/K0gPht)

> The **Query Include Optimized** feature may sometimes reduce the performance. For example, when some database indexes are missing.

### Download
To use this feature, you need to download the following [NuGet Package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Z.EntityFramework.Plus.QueryIncludeOptimized.EFClassic/)

### Entity Framework Classic - Integration
The **Query Include Optimized** feature will eventually integrate directly in **Entity Framework Classic**.

It's planned that this feature gets a major revamp to work more easily with include methods such as `Include` and `IncludeFilter`.

# Dapper Transaction: A Getting Started Tutorial to use Transaction

## What's Dapper Transaction?

**Dapper.Transaction** is exactly like `Dapper` but extends the `IDbTransaction` interface instead and uses `Dapper` under the hood. It's a simple library to make it easier to work with a transaction.

 - **Dapper.Transaction** is a simple and lightweight transaction management tool for Dapper. 
 - Everything `Dapper` support, `Dapper Transaction` supports it as well (It's only a new extension method calling Dapper)
 - It was created to provide an easy way to manage transactions within the Dapper micro-ORM.

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(FiddleHelper.GetConnectionStringSqlServerW3Schools()))
{
	connection.Open();
	
	using (var transaction = connection.BeginTransaction())
	{
		// Dapper
		var affectedRows1 = connection.Execute(sql, new {CustomerName = "Mark"}, transaction: transaction);
		
		// Dapper Transaction
		var affectedRows2 = transaction.Execute(sql, new {CustomerName = "Mark"});

		transaction.Commit();
	}
}
```

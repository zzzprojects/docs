# Dapper.Contrib: A Getting Started Tutorial for CRUD Operations

## Overview

**Dapper.Contrib** is a small library that you can add to your project which will extend the `IDbConnection` interface with additional helper methods for CRUD operations, such as inserting, deleting, updating, getting records, and mapping database results to strongly typed objects.

 - The key feature of **Dapper.Contrib** is its ability to automatically map an object to a table in your database. 
 - It means that you don't have to write any SQL code to CRUD your data. 
 - All you need is your model/entity and **Dapper.Contrib** will handle the rest.
 - It adds basic CRUD operations (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) for your models/entities.

## Why should you use Dapper Contrib?

Using **Dapper.Contrib** is a personal choice. It allows the developer to save time using the existing method that generates **SQL** instead of writing it.

One of the biggest advantages of **Dapper.Contrib** is the ability to track your entities and identify if changes have been made when you retrieve entities with the `Get` or `GetAll` methods.

So, if there is any change and you call the `Update` method, it will generate the SQL and update only those properties that have been changed.

## NuGet Installation

**Dapper.Contrib** is available through NuGet: <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Dapper.Contrib/" target="_blank">https://www.nuget.org/packages/Dapper.Contrib/</a>

You can easily install this library by running the following command:

```csharp
PM> Install-Package Dapper.Contrib
```

More information and documentation can be found at: <a href="https://github.com/DapperLib/Dapper.Contrib">https://github.com/DapperLib/Dapper.Contrib</a>

## APIs

Once you install this library, the following extension methods will automatically be added to `DbConnection`:

- [Get](/get)
- [GetAll](/getall)
- [Insert](/insert)
- [Update](/update)
- [Delete](/delete)
- [DeleteAll](/deleteall)

You can use these extension methods easily in your code.

```csharp
var invoice = connection.Get<InvoiceContrib>(1);
var invoices = connection.GetAll<InvoiceContrib>().ToList();
var identity = connection.Insert(new InvoiceContrib {Kind = InvoiceKind.WebInvoice, Code = "Insert_Single_1"});
var isSuccess = connection.Update(new InvoiceContrib {InvoiceID = 1, Code = "Update_Single_1"});
var isSuccess = connection.Delete(new InvoiceContrib {InvoiceID = 1});
var isSuccess = connection.DeleteAll<InvoiceContrib>();
```

**Dapper.Contrib** also allows mapping for special attributes using Data Annotations:

- **Key**: Specify the property as a key that is automatically generated by the database.
- **ExplicitKey**: Specify the property as a key explicitly that is not automatically generated by the database.
- **Table**: Specify the destination table name mapped to the entity.
- **Write**: Specify the property if it is writable or not.
- **Computed**: Specify the property that should be excluded from an update.

```csharp
[Table("Invoice")]
public class InvoiceContrib
{
	[Key]
	public int InvoiceID { get; set; }
	public string Code { get; set; }
	public InvoiceKind Kind { get; set; }

	[Write(false)]
	[Computed]
	public string FakeProperty { get; set; }
}

using (var connection = My.ConnectionFactory())
{
	connection.Open();

	var invoices = connection.GetAll<InvoiceContrib>().ToList();

	// The FakeProperty is skipped
	invoices.ForEach(x => x.FakeProperty += "z");

	var isSuccess = connection.Update(invoices);
}
```

Unfortunately, there is no proper documentation available for this library, but you can get a little bit of help from: <a href="https://github.com/StackExchange/Dapper/tree/master/Dapper.Contrib" target="_blank">https://github.com/StackExchange/Dapper/tree/master/Dapper.Contrib</a>

## Limitations

There is no support for composite key mapping.

**Dapper.Contrib** has an `Update` extension method, and `SQLiteConnection` also exposes an `Update` event that clashes with each other. But you can easily resolve the clash by using any of the following techniques:

- Pass a type parameter to the Update method

```csharp
var isSuccess = connection.Update<InvoiceContrib>(new InvoiceContrib {InvoiceID = 1, Code = "Update_Single_1"});
```

- The other way is to call the Update method explicitly using SqlMapperExtensions.

```csharp
var isSuccess = SqlMapperExtensions.Update(connection, new InvoiceContrib {InvoiceID = 1, Code = "Update_Single_2"});
```

### Support

This library is supported regularly, and you will receive your answers within the next few days. <a href="https://github.com/DapperLib/Dapper.Contrib/issues">https://github.com/DapperLib/Dapper.Contrib/issues</a>

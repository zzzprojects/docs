# Dapper.FluentMap: A Getting Started Tutorial for Mapping

## Overview

**Dapper.FluentMap** is a small library that allows you to fluently map properties of your domain classes to the database columns. This library functionality is similar to Entity Framework Fluent API and keeps your domain classes clean of mapping attributes.

 - It is straightforward to set up; just create a map class for each of your domain model and database model classes, and configure the mappings using the fluent API. 
 - Once you have done that, you can use **Dapper.FluentMap** to automatically map your classes to each other.
 - By default, Dapper will map an object's properties to columns with the same name. 
 - However, sometimes you might want to map an object's properties to columns with different names. 
 - It allows you to configure these mappings in a fluent, concise way.

## NuGet Installation

**Dapper.FluentMap** is available through NuGet: <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Dapper.FluentMap/" target="_blank">https://www.nuget.org/packages/Dapper.FluentMap/</a>

You can easily install this library by running the following command:

```csharp
PM> Install-Package Dapper.FluentMap
```

## APIs

There are two types of mapping supported in **Dapper.FluentMap**.

- Manual mapping
- Convention-based mapping

You can map property names manually using the `EntityMap<TEntity>` class.

```csharp

public class InvoiceMap : EntityMap<Invoice>
{
    public InvoiceMap()
    {
        // Map property 'InvoiceID' to column 'Id'.
        Map(i => i.InvoiceID).ToColumn("Id");

        // Ignore the 'Detail' and 'Items' properties when mapping.
        Map(i => i.Detail).Ignore();
        Map(i => i.Items).Ignore();
    }
}

```

Initialize your mapping at the start of your application.

```csharp
FluentMapper.Initialize(config =>
{
    config.AddMap(new InvoiceMap());
});
```

Unfortunately, there is no proper documentation available for this library, but you can get a little bit of help from: <a href="https://github.com/henkmollema/Dapper-FluentMap" target="_blank">https://github.com/henkmollema/Dapper-FluentMap</a>

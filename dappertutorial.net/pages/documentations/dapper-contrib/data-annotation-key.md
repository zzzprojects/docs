# Dapper Contrib Key: Use Data Annotation to Specify Key Column

## Description

The Data Annotation `Key` Attribute is used to specify the primary key of a table. It is applied to a property of a class that maps to a primary key column in a database table. It specifies the property as a key that is automatically generated by the database (Identity Column).

 - The `Key` attribute can be applied to a property in an entity class to make it a key property and the corresponding column in the database table will be configured as a primary key.
 - When the `Key` attribute is applied to a property, the property becomes a part of the entity's key and cannot be changed or assigned a new value. 
 - An error will be generated if we try to update the key property.

 In the following example, the `InvoiceID` is decorated with a `Key` attribute to specify the primary key of a table.

```csharp
[Table("Invoice")]
public class InvoiceContrib
{
	[Key]
	public int InvoiceID { get; set; }

	public string Code { get; set; }
	public InvoiceKind Kind { get; set; }

	[Write(false)]
	[Computed]
	public string FakeProperty { get; set; }
}

using (var connection = My.ConnectionFactory())
{
	connection.Open();

	var identity = connection.Insert(new InvoiceContrib {Kind = InvoiceKind.WebInvoice, Code = "Insert_Single_1"});
}
```

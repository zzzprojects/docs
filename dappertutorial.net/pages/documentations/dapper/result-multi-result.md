# Dapper Multi-Result Result: Discover How to Map With Multiple Results

## Description

The multi-result is the ability to map a single query to multiple objects. It is useful when you need to select data from multiple tables or when you need to select multiple columns from a single table. Dapper supports this by providing an extension method called [QueryMultiple](/querymultiple).

 - The `QueryMultiple` can be called from any object of type `IDbConnection`. 
 - It can execute multiple queries within the same command and map results.
 - It will return a result set for each type you pass in and you can then use the `Read<T>` method on each result set to get an `IEnumerable<T>` for that result set.

 The following example shows how to execute two SQL statements in one round trip to the database. In the first query, we get all invoices from the `Invoices` table, and in the second query, we get all invoice items from the `InvoiceItems` table. 

```csharp
string sql = "SELECT * FROM Invoice WHERE InvoiceID = @InvoiceID; SELECT * FROM InvoiceItem WHERE InvoiceID = @InvoiceID;";

using (var connection = My.ConnectionFactory())
{
    connection.Open();

    using (var multi = connection.QueryMultiple(sql, new {InvoiceID = 1}))
    {
        var invoice = multi.Read<Invoice>().First();
        var invoiceItems = multi.Read<InvoiceItem>().ToList();
    }
}
```

In the above example, you can see that we have mapped the results of both queries to the `Invoice` and `InvoiceItem` classes.

# Dapper Query Single: Discover How to Return a Single Result Row

## Description

The `QuerySingle` extension method returns the instance of the specified type with the first record fetched from the database table, otherwise, it will throw an exception if no records are returned by the query.

 - The most basic usage of `QuerySingle` is to provide only the ID column as the parameter. 
 - In this case, Dapper will automatically map the result to an object of type `T`. 
 - `QuerySingle` is a very useful operation when you need to retrieve only a single row from the database.

You can call the `QuerySingle` from any object of type `IDbConnection` and the result can be mapped to:

- [Anonymous](#example---query-anonymous)
- [Strongly Typed](#example---query-strongly-typed)

### Parameters

The syntax of the `QuerySingle<T>` method is given below:

```csharp
T QuerySingle<T>(string sql, 
                 object param = null, 
				 IDbTransaction transaction = null, 
				 int? commandTimeout = null, 
				 CommandType? commandType = null);
```

The `QuerySingle` method takes a SQL query as a string and an optional object parameter. The object parameter can be used to pass parameters to the SQL query.

The `QuerySingle` method also takes optional parameters for transaction, command timeout, and command type.

The following table shows the different parameters of a `QuerySingle` method.

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :---------- |
| sql            | It represents an SQL query or stored procedure. This parameter is required. |
| param          | It represents the parameters required by SQL query or stored procedure. This parameter is optional. We can pass the parameter to SQL in anonymous type, `dynamic` object, or `Dapper.DynamicParameters` class. |
| transaction    | It represents a database transaction. This parameter is optional if we are using this method outside of a transaction, otherwise, it is required. |
| commandTimeout | It represents the time in seconds to wait before terminating the command execution and generating an error. The default value of this parameter is 30 seconds. This parameter is optional. |
| commandType    | It specifies how SQL query or stored procedure should be interpreted by the data provider. The default value of this parameter is Text. This parameter is optional. |

### First, Single & Default

First, Single & Default methods are very different. When choosing between the different methods of querying data from a database using Dapper, it is important to understand the differences between them to make the best decision for your particular needs.

`QueryFirst` and `QuerySingle` both return a single record from the database, be careful to use the right method because there are some important distinctions between the two that are mentioned in the following table.

| Result          | No Item   | One Item | Many Items |
| :-------------- | :-------: | :------: | :--------: |
| First           | Exception | Item     | First Item |
| Single          | Exception | Item     | Exception  |
| FirstOrDefault  | Default   | Item     | First Item |
| SingleOrDefault | Default   | Item     | Exception  |

When deciding which method to use, it is important to consider the particular needs of your application. 

## Example - QuerySingle Anonymous

The raw SQL query can be executed using the `QuerySingle` method, which maps the first result to a dynamic list and throws an exception if there is not exactly one element in the sequence. 

You could store the results of this query in a [Dapper anonymous result type](/result-anonymous) as follows:

```csharp
string sql = "SELECT * FROM OrderDetails WHERE OrderDetailID = @OrderDetailID;";

using (var connection = new SqlConnection(FiddleHelper.GetConnectionStringSqlServerW3Schools()))
{	
	var orderDetail = connection.QuerySingle(sql, new {OrderDetailID = 1});

	FiddleHelper.WriteTable(orderDetail);
}
```

These are useful for simple queries where you don't need to create a separate class to represent your data. This can save you a considerable amount of time and effort when working with complex SQL queries.

## Example - QuerySingle Strongly Typed

Dapper provides you with the ability to get your [query results as strongly typed objects](/result-strongly-typed) instead of just getting back a dynamic object. The raw SQL query can be executed using the `QuerySingle` method which maps the first result to a strongly typed list and throws an exception if there is not exactly one element in the sequence.

First, let's create a simple class that we can use to map our query results and we will call this class `OrderDetail`.

```csharp
public class OrderDetail
{
	public int OrderDetailID { get; set; }
	public int OrderID { get; set; }
	public int ProductID { get; set; }
	public int Quantity { get; set; }
}
```

Next, we write our SQL query to fetch a particular OrderDetail from our database.

```csharp
string sql = "SELECT * FROM OrderDetails WHERE OrderDetailID = @OrderDetailID;";

using (var connection = new SqlConnection(FiddleHelper.GetConnectionStringSqlServerW3Schools()))
{			
	var orderDetail = connection.QuerySingle<OrderDetail>(sql, new {OrderDetailID = 1});

	FiddleHelper.WriteTable(new List<OrderDetail>() { orderDetail });
}
```

In the above example, you can see that Dapper makes it very easy to map your query results to strongly typed objects.

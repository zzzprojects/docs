# Dapper Plus Bulk Delete: Discover how to delete multiple rows

## Description

The [BulkDelete](https://dapper-plus.net/bulk-delete) method allows you to delete multiple entities in one database call. It is useful when you want to delete a large number of records from a table. You can use the `BulkDelete` method to delete all records from a table, or you can specify a filter condition to only delete certain records. 

It deletes entities using bulk operations. With `BulkDelete`, you can:

- [Delete single](#example-delete-single)
- [Delete many](#example-delete-many)
- [Delete with relation (One to One)](#example-delete-with-relation-one-to-one)
- [Delete with relation (One to Many)](#example-delete-with-relation-one-to-many)

To use the `BulkDelete` method, you simply need to specify the list of entities that you want to delete.

## Example - Delete Single

You can use the `BulkDelete` method to delete a single record. The following example deletes a single record from the **Customers** table.

```csharp 
// @nuget: Z.Dapper.Plus
using Z.Dapper.Plus;
   
DapperPlusManager.Entity<Customer>().Table("Customers").Key("CustomerID");

using (var connection = new SqlConnection(FiddleHelper.GetConnectionStringSqlServerW3Schools()))
{
    connection.BulkDelete(connection.Query<Customer>("Select * FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE CustomerID in (53,57) ").ToList());
}    
```

## Example - Delete Many

The `BulkDelete` method can delete multiple records with a single database call which can significantly improve performance by deleting multiple entities with bulk operations. The following example deletes a list of customers from the **Customers** table.

```csharp
// @nuget: Z.Dapper.Plus
using Z.Dapper.Plus;

DapperPlusManager.Entity<Customer>().Table("Customers").Key("CustomerID");

using (var connection = new SqlConnection(FiddleHelper.GetConnectionStringSqlServerW3Schools()))
{
    connection.BulkDelete(connection.Query<Customer>("Select * FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE CustomerID in (53,57) ").ToList());
}    
```

## Example - Delete with relation (One to One)

`BulkDelete` allows you to delete related entities from the database in one database operation. It is especially useful when deleting a large number of entities that have relationships with each other. 

To use `BulkDelete` when entities have a relationship, simply specify the relationship between the entities when you configure the bulk operation.

The following example shows how to use the `BulkDelete` with a one-to-one relationship between the entities.

```csharp
// @nuget: Z.Dapper.Plus
using Z.Dapper.Plus;

DapperPlusManager.Entity<Supplier>().Table("Suppliers").Identity(x => x.SupplierID);
DapperPlusManager.Entity<Product>().Table("Products").Identity(x => x.ProductID);

using (var connection = new SqlConnection(FiddleHelper.GetConnectionStringSqlServerW3Schools()))
{
    connection.BulkDelete(suppliers.Select(x => x.Product)).BulkDelete(suppliers);
}
```
Try it: [.NET Core](https://dotnetfiddle.net/jLDQj3) | [.NET Framework](https://dotnetfiddle.net/U6CGtD)

## Example - Delete with relation (One to Many)

Dapper Plus also allows you to delete a list of entities with a one-to-many relationship with bulk operations as shown in the following example.

```csharp
// @nuget: Z.Dapper.Plus
using Z.Dapper.Plus;

DapperPlusManager.Entity<Supplier>().Table("Suppliers").Identity(x => x.SupplierID);
DapperPlusManager.Entity<Product>().Table("Products").Identity(x => x.ProductID);

using (var connection = new SqlConnection(FiddleHelper.GetConnectionStringSqlServerW3Schools()))
{
    connection.BulkDelete(suppliers.SelectMany(x => x.Products)).BulkDelete(suppliers);
}
```

# Entity Framework Find: Discover How to Find an Entity By Key

Finds an entity with the given primary key values. 

 - If an entity with the given primary key values exists in the context, then it is returned immediately without requesting the store. 
 - Otherwise, a request is made to the store for an entity with the given primary key values and this entity, if found, is attached to the context and returned. 
 - If no entity is found in the context or the store, then null is returned.

```csharp
using (var context = new BookStore())
{
    var authors = context.Authors
        .Find(2);
}
```

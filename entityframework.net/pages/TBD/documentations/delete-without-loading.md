## How to delete without loading entities in the context? 

Deleting entities using SaveChanges requires typically to load them first in the ChangeTracker. These additional round-trips are often not necessary.

## Answer

[Entity Framework Extensions](https://entityframework-extensions.net/) library adds the DeleteFromQuery extension method. **DeleteFromQuery** gives you access to directly execute a `DELETE` statement in the database and provide a **HUGE** performance improvement.

 - DELETE all rows from the database using a LINQ Query without loading entities in the context.
 - A DELETE statement is built using the LINQ expression and directly executed in the database.


```csharp
// DELETE all customers that are inactive
context.Customers.Where(c => !c.IsActive).DeleteFromQuery();

// DELETE customers by id
context.Customers.Where(x => x.CustomerID == customerId).DeleteFromQuery();
```

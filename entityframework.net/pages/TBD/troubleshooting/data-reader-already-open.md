## Solution

This can happen if you execute a query while iterating over the results from another query.

### Solution 1

 - This can be easily solved by allowing MARS in your connection string. 
 - Add `MultipleActiveResultSets=true` to the provider part of your connection string.

```csharp
<connectionStrings>
    <add name="BloggingContextDb" connectionString="Data Source=(localdb)\ProjectsV13;Initial Catalog=BloggingContextDb;
        MultipleActiveResultSets=true;" providerName="System.Data.SqlClient" />
</connectionStrings>
```

 - Enabling MARS should only be done for a very small subset of problems/use-cases. 
 - In most cases, the error is caused by BAD CODE within the calling application. 

### Solution 2

Adding .ToList() to the collection used in the foreach loop will likely solve the problem.


```csharp
var blogs = blogs.ToList();
foreach (var blog in blogs)
{
    blog.Name += " updated";
    blog.Url += " updated";
    context.SaveChanges();
}
```

### Solution 3

Call SaveChanges() outside foreach loop


```csharp
foreach (var blog in blogs)
{
    blog.Name += " updated";
    blog.Url += " updated";
}
context.SaveChanges();
```

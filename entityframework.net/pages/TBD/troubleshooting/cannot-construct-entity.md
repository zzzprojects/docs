# Entity Framework: The entity cannot be constructed in a LINQ Exception

## Exception: The entity cannot be constructed in a LINQ to Entities query

In Entity Framework, mapped entities represent database tables, and Entity Framework doesn't allow projecting on a mapped entity in a LINQ to Entities query.  If you project on a mapped entity, then it will partially load an entity, which is not a valid state. EF won't have any clue how to handle it when the entity is updated.

```csharp
using (var context = new CustomerContext())
{
    var customer = context.Customers.Where(c => c.CustomerID == 1)
        .Select(c => new Customer()
        {
            Name = c.Name
        })
        .FirstOrDefault();
}
```

## Solution

### Anonymous Type

The most straightforward solution to handle this exception is to project on anonymous type.

```csharp
using (var context = new CustomerContext())
{
    var customer = context.Customers.Where(c => c.CustomerID == 1)
        .Select(c => new 
        {
            Name = c.Name
        })
        .FirstOrDefault();
}
```

### DTO
You can also project on Data Transfer Objects (DTO)

```csharp
using (var context = new CustomerContext())
{
    var customer = context.Customers.Where(c => c.CustomerID == 1)
        .Select(c => new CustomerDTO()
        {
            Name = c.Name
        })
        .FirstOrDefault();
}
```

The DTO class will look like this.

```csharp
public class CustomerDTO
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
}
```

### Anonymous Type to Strongly Type

Another way of handling this problem is to project into anonymous type first and then map anonymous type to mapped entity or model entity.

```csharp
using (var context = new CustomerContext())
{
    var customers = context.Customers.Where(c => c.CustomerID == 1)
        .Select(c => new
        {
            Name = c.Name
        })
        .ToList()
        .Select(x => new Customer { Name = x.Name })
        .ToList();
}
```

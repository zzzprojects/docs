## Answer

### Code First Approach

 - Code First is a very popular approach and has full control over the code rather than database activity. 
 - In this approach, we can do all the database operations from the code and manual changes to the database will be lost and everything depends on the code.
 - In this approach, you need to create POCO entities as the data model.

### Database First Approach

 - The Database first approach is used when the database is ready then Entity Framework will complete its duty and create POCO entities for you.
 - If you already have a designed database and you don't want to make extra effort then you can go with this approach.
 - You can modify the database manually and update the model from the database. 
 - So, we can say, entity framework is able to create your model classes based on tables and columns from a relational database.

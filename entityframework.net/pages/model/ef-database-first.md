# Entity Framework Database First: Discover How to Use this Approach

## What is Entity Framework Database First? 

When you start learning Entity Framework, you will also often see the term **Entity Framework Database First**. Database first is one of the three approaches to create an entity model.

## Answer

In the Entity Framework, the Database First Approach provides an alternative to the Code First by creating POCO classes from the existing database.

 - Database first approach is used when a database is ready; then Entity Framework will complete its duty and create POCO entities for you
 - If you already had a designed database and you don't want to make extra effort, then you can go with this approach.
 - You can modify the database manually and update the model from a database. 
 - So, we can say, entity framework can create your model classes based on tables and columns from the relational database.

## Create Model Using Database First Approach

In the [Code First](/ef-code-first), we have created a database from a DbContext and classes. 

 - It is also possible to reverse engineer an existing database into a DbContext and classes, and it is known as Database First approach.
 - We have a simple database created which contains `Books` table.

Let's create a new empty project and add the EntityFramework NuGet package which is explained in the [Code First](/ef-code-first) approach.
 
We will use the Entity Framework Designer, which is included as part of Visual Studio, to create our model.

Right click on the project in Solution Explorer and choose `Add > New Item...` option.

Select Data from the left menu and then `ADO.NET Entity Data Model`.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zzzprojects/EntityFramework-FAQ/master/docs2/images/database-first2.png" alt="Database-first-2">

Enter **BookStore** as the name and click **Add**. This launches the Entity Data Model Wizard. Select **EF Designer from Database** and click **Next**.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zzzprojects/EntityFramework-FAQ/master/docs2/images/database-first3.png" alt="Database-first-3">

Select the connection to the database you created in the [Code First](/ef-code-first), enter BookContext as the name of the connection string and click **Next**.

Click the checkbox next to Tables you want to import and click **Finish**.

Now let's look at the new DbContext class.

```csharp
//------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// <auto-generated>
//     This code was generated from a template.
//
//     Manual changes to this file may cause unexpected behavior in your application.
//     Manual changes to this file will be overwritten if the code is regenerated.
// </auto-generated>
//------------------------------------------------------------------------------

namespace DatabaseFirst
{
    using System;
    using System.Data.Entity;
    using System.Data.Entity.Infrastructure;
    
    public partial class BookContext : DbContext
    {
        public BookContext()
            : base("name=BookContext")
        {
        }
    
        protected override void OnModelCreating(DbModelBuilder modelBuilder)
        {
            throw new UnintentionalCodeFirstException();
        }
    
        public virtual DbSet<Book> Books { get; set; }
    }
}

```

You can see that DbSet property is created `Book` Entity class. You can now use a LINQ query to read/write from/to the database.

```csharp
using (var db = new BookContext())
{
    db.Books.Add(new Book { Title = "Introduction to Programming", Date = DateTime.Now});
    db.SaveChanges();

    foreach (var book in db.Books)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(book.Title);
    }
}
```

## Update Model From Database

You can also update your model when the Database changes. Let's add `AuthorName` column to the database. 

To update model from the database, right-click the .edmx file and select Update Model from Database. 

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zzzprojects/EntityFramework-FAQ/master/docs2/images/database-first5.png" alt="Database-first-5">

Expand the Tables, Views, and Stored Procedures nodes, and check the objects you want to add to the .edmx file.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zzzprojects/EntityFramework-FAQ/master/docs2/images/database-first6.png" alt="Database-first-6">

Click **Finish** to update the .edmx file with the database changes.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zzzprojects/EntityFramework-FAQ/master/docs2/images/database-first7.png" alt="Database-first-7">

You can see that `AuthorName` property is added to the model, now we need to update the `Book` class as well. 

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zzzprojects/EntityFramework-FAQ/master/docs2/images/database-first8.png" alt="Database-first-8">

To update the table field changes in the BookStore.tt file, right-click on BookStore.tt file and choose **Run Custom Tool**.

```csharp
//------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// <auto-generated>
//     This code was generated from a template.
//
//     Manual changes to this file may cause unexpected behavior in your application.
//     Manual changes to this file will be overwritten if the code is regenerated.
// </auto-generated>
//------------------------------------------------------------------------------

namespace DatabaseFirst
{
    using System;
    using System.Collections.Generic;
    
    public partial class Book
    {
        public int BookId { get; set; }
        public string Title { get; set; }
        public System.DateTime Date { get; set; }
        public string Publisher { get; set; }
        public string AuthorName { get; set; }
    }
}
```

Now you can see that the `Book` class is also updated.

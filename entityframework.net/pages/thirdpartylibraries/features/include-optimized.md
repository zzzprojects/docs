# Entity Framework Include Optimized: Discover who supports this feature

## Introduction

IncludeOptimized allows you to optimize the query generated by EF by executing multiple smaller queries instead of executing only one monster SQL.

## Why IncludeOptimized?

### Common Scenarios:

 - The SQL generated by Entity Framework is too big and takes several seconds or minutes to execute.

```csharp
// SELECT * FROM Order WHERE....
// SELECT * FROM OrderItem WHERE EXISTS (/* previous query */) AND ...
// SELECT * FROM DeliveryItems WHERE EXISTS (/* previous query */) AND ...

var orders = ctx.Orders
                .Where(x => x.OrderId == myOrderID) // 1 orders, 20 columns
                .IncludeOptimized(x => x.Items) // 20 items, 10 columns
                .IncludeOptimized(x => x.DeliveredItems) // 10 items, 10 columns
                .ToList();
```

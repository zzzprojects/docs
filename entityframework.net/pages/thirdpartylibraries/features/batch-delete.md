# Entity Framework Batch Delete: Discover who supports this feature

## Introduction

Batch Delete allows you to improve EF performance by deleting multiple records in a database from a LINQ Query without loading entities.

## Why Batch Delete?

For **HUGE** performance gains, everything is executed on the database side. To use batch delete, you will need to use a third-party library.

# Improve EF Include Performance

## How to Improve Entity Framework Include Performance?

Entity Framework does a great job to generate SQL. However, they are often very far to be optimized.

```csharp
using (var ctx = new CustomerContext())
{
    var customers = ctx.Customers
        .Include(x => x.Orders.Select(y => y.Items.Select(z => z.Product))
        .Include(x => x.Payments.Select(y => y.Items)
        .Include(x => x.Shippings.Select(y => y.Items)
        .ToList();
}
```

## Answer

 - SPLIT the LINQ query in multiple queries
 - USE EF+ Query IncludeOptimized (**Recommended**)

### SPLIT the LINQ query into multiple queries

You don't have to include everything in the same query, the divide and conquer strategy can apply here also!

#### Pros

 - Convert the BIG monster query generated by Entity Framework into multiple tiny monsters
 - Return less NULL value

#### Cons

 - Can sometimes be slower than Include
 - Cannot be used with AsNoTracking()
 - Multiple database round-trips is required

#### How?

 1. SPLIT the queries in multiple smaller queries
 2. Done!

```csharp
using (var ctx = new CustomerContext())
{
    // 1. SPLIT the queries into multiple smaller queries
    var customers = ctx.Customers
            .Include(x => x.Orders.Select(y => y.Items.Select(z => z.Product))
            .ToList();
                    
    var customers = ctx.Customers
            .Include(x => x.Payments.Select(y => y.Items)
            .ToList();
                       
    var customers = ctx.Customers
            .Include(x => x.Shippings.Select(y => y.Items)
            .ToList();
                     
    // 2. Done!
}
```

### USE EF+ Query IncludeOptimized (**Recommended**)

[Entity Framework Plus](/ef-plus) library contains IncludeOptimized extension method which under the hood also split the query into multiples queries but way more:

 - Easier
 - Faster
 - Flexible

#### Pros

 - Easier to use than splitting queries
 - One database round-trip is required
 - Bonus: Allow to filter related entities

#### Cons

 - Can sometimes be slower than Include
 - Cannot be used with AsNoTracking()
 - Cannot be mixed with Include

#### How?

 1. CHANGE all Include by IncludeOptimized
 2. Done!
 

```csharp
using (var ctx = new CustomerContext())
{
    // 1. CHANGE all Include by IncludeOptimized
    var customers = ctx.Customers
            .IncludeOptimized(x => x.Orders.Select(y => y.Items.Select(z => z.Product))
            .IncludeOptimized(x => x.Payments.Select(y => y.Items)
            .IncludeOptimized(x => x.Shippings.Select(y => y.Items)
            .ToList();
                       
    // 2. Done!
}
```

People looking at the SQL generated often become speechless.

Did you really scroll down all the code to see all the SQL generated to execute this query?

***Suprised? Astonished? Flabbergasted?***

Yes, this is what I call a monster SQL, and if you execute it, most columns will contains a NULL value which makes it even worse.

Let's now look what's the SQL generated by IncludeOptimized method


```csharp
//EF+ Query Future: 1 of 4

That's for sure not the most optimized SQL, but it's already way more readable.

## Answer

For IEnumerable<T>, using **Any()** method is the fastest way to check if the object exists in the database. It only has to look at one iteration and will return as soon as it finds a match.


```csharp
using (var context = new EntityContext())
{
    if(context.Customers.Any(c => c.CustomerID == 1))
    {
        //match
    }  
}
```

# Entity Framework Include: Discover how to Specify Related Entities

In Entity Framework, the `Include` method loads the related objects to include in the query results. It can be used to retrieve some information from the database and also to include related entities. 

We have a simple model which contains two entities.

```csharp
public class Book
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Title { get; set; }
    public int AuthorId { get; set; }
    [ForeignKey("AuthorId")]
    public Author Author { get; set; }
}

public class Author
{
    public int AuthorId { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public ICollection<Book> Books { get; set; }
}
```

## Lambda Expression

The following LINQ query loads all authors, and their related books using the lambda expression.

```csharp
using (var context = new BookStore())
{
    var authors = context.Authors
        .Include(a => a.Books)
        .ToList();
}
```

## String Path

You can also use a string path to specify the relationships to load all authors and their related books.

```csharp
using (var context = new BookStore())
{
    var authors = context.Authors
        .Include("Books")
        .ToList();
}
```

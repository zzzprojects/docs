# Entity Framework View Generated SQL: Discover How to View SQL Generated

## How to view the SQL Generated by Entity Framework

Entity Framework follows the following three steps.

 - Translate C# code into SQL statements
 - Execute SQL on a target database
 - Return values back to C# objects. 

Now the question is how the generated SQL statements look like and how we can view the SQL executed on the database.

## Answer

The simple way of viewing the SQL generated is to use reflection to create an **ObjectQuery** object and then call the **ToTraceString()** method to actually store the query results.


```csharp
using (var context = new EntityContext())
{
    var query = context.Customers.Where(c => c.Id == 1); 
    var sql = ((System.Data.Objects.ObjectQuery)query).ToTraceString();  
}
```

### EF SQL Logging

Entity Framework team added support for interception and logging of generated SQL in EF6. The DbContext.Database.Log property can be set to a delegate for any method that takes a string.

#### Log SQL to the Console.


```csharp
using (var context = new EntityContext())
{
    context.Database.Log = Console.Write; 
    // query here ....  
}
```

#### Log SQL to Visual Studio Output panel.


```csharp
using (var context = new EntityContext())
{
    context.Database.Log = s => System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine(s); 
    // query here ....  
}
```

#### Log SQL to an External File


```csharp
using (var context = new EntityContext())
{
    using (var sqlLogFile = new StreamWriter("C:\\temp\\LogFile.txt"))
    {          
         context.Database.Log = sqlLogFile.Write;
         // query here ....
   }   
}
```

Let's execute some examples and see the output on the console window.


```csharp
using (var context = new EntityContext())
{
    context.Database.Log = Console.Write;
    var customers = context.Customers.ToList();    
}
```

    [Extent1].[Name] AS [Name]

Use some condition. 


```csharp
using (var context = new EntityContext())
{
    context.Database.Log = Console.Write;
    var customers = context.Customers
        .Include(x => x.Invoices)
        .Where(c => "c.Invoices.Count > 0")
        .OrderByDescendingDynamic(c => "c.Invoices.Count")
        .ToList();    
}
```

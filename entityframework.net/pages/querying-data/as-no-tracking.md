# Entity Framework AsNoTracking: Discover How Not Tracking Entities

In the Entity Framework, the `DbContext` keeps track of all the changes done in the objects, so that the correct update is done to the database when the `SaveChanges()` method of the context is called. 

 - When you execute the query, the Entity Framework puts these entities in a cache and tracks whatever changes are made on these entities until the `SaveChanges()` method is called.
 - But sometimes you do not need to track some entities, such as, retrieving the data for viewing purposes.

## What is AsNoTracking?

`AsNoTracking()` is an extension method which returns a new query and the returned entities will not be cached by the context.

 - You can call this method as an instance method on any object of type `IQueryable`. 
 - After calling this method, Entity Framework will not perform any additional processing or storage of the entities that are returned by the query. 

## Example

```csharp
using (var context = new BookStore())
{
    var authors = context.Authors
        .AsNoTracking()
        .ToList();
}
```

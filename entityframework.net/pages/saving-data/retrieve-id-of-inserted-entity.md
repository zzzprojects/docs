## Answer

It is pretty easy. If you are using DB generated Ids (like `IDENTITY` in MS SQL) you just need to add entity to the context and call SaveChanges on that context. Id will be automatically filled for you.


```csharp
using (var context = new EntityContext())
{
	var customer = new Customer()
	{
		Name = "John"
	};

	context.Customers.Add(customer);
	context.SaveChanges();
		
	int id = customer.CustomerID;
}
```

Entity framework by default follows each `INSERT` with SELECT `SCOPE_IDENTITY()` when auto-generated Ids are used.

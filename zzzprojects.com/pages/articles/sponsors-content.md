# ZZZ Projects Loves Your Content 💖 Sponsorship Invitation

Welcome to our *super hidden page* 👀

If you’ve received this link, it means we’d love to sponsor your content 🎉🥳

---

## 🎯 Our Mission

Our mission has always been simple: build a business devoted to adding value to the .NET community.

And now? It’s the perfect time to prove it. In 2025, we plan to sponsor over **30 content creators** – and guess what? You’ve been selected as one of them!

We’re mainly looking for **long-term sponsorships**. As long as you keep posting quality content, we’ll keep supporting you 💪

---

## 💸 What Do We Want to Sponsor?

We can’t sponsor *everything* related to .NET — at least not right away. It takes time for sponsored content to show ROI (return on investment).

Right now, we mainly focus on content related to:

* EF Core
* Dapper

---

## ✅ Quality Over Quantity

"Anything" doesn’t mean *just anything*.

While we’re happy to sponsor most of your content, our focus is on work that **adds real value** to the .NET community.

If your posts are low effort, purely reposts, or lack depth, we may stop the sponsorship.

For example, take a look at the flood of `AsNoTracking` posts:
👉 [https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?keywords=AsNoTracking](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?keywords=AsNoTracking)

Everyone knows its value by now. Posting the same thing as 100 others doesn’t really help.

We don’t mind the occasional repetitive post — but if *every* post is like that, we’ll need to rethink things.

---

## 📝 What Kind of Content Do We Sponsor?

Pretty much anything you’re already doing — either **dedicated content** about our libraries or **sponsored content** related to EF Core or Dapper.

### Dedicated Content

* Newsletter Post
* Website Post
* LinkedIn Post
* Twitter Post
* YouTube Video

### Sponsored Content

* Newsletter Ads
* Website Ads
* LinkedIn Ads
* Twitter Ads
* YouTube Video Ads

You can find some example of ads on our [sponsors ads page](https://github.com/zzzprojects/docs/blob/master/zzzprojects.com/pages/sponsors-ads.md)

Have another idea? We’re all ears — suggest it!

---

## 💼 Pricing and Contract

All pricing is discussed via email.

Rates usually depend on:

* Your audience size
* The quality of your content

We typically don’t require a signed contract. We trust that everyone understands:

* Sponsored content and ads should remain **permanently available**, even after sponsorship ends.

---

## 📊 Content Report

Since we’re sponsoring over 30 creators, we can’t track everything ourselves — **that’s your job** 😄

Please keep a simple record (Excel, Google Sheets, Notion — whatever works for you). Just include:

* Content Type
* Date
* URL

We’re flexible on the format, as long as it stays up to date.

Send it to us every once in a while. Easy!

---

## 🔗 URL Tag

To track performance, please use `utm` metadata in your sponsored links. Example:

Here is an example: 

```csharp
https://entityframework-extensions.net/?utm_source=[your_name]&utm_medium=[content_type]&utm_campaign=[campaign_name]
```

You don’t need a unique URL for every post. Feel free to re-use the same one for all your LinkedIn posts, but a dedicated newsletter should have its own unique URL so we can measure its value accurately.

---

## ✅ Final Words

Bookmark this page and check back once in a while — this is version 1 of the sponsorship page, and we’ll be improving it over time.

We’re super easygoing and try to keep everything as flexible as possible 😊

# ZZZ Projects loves your work  💖 Sponsorship Invitation

Welcome to our *super hidden* page 👀

If you’ve received this link, that means we’d love to sponsor **your work** 🎉🥳

---

## 🎯 Our Mission

Our mission has always been simple: **A business devoted to adding value to the .NET community**.

And now? It’s the perfect time to *prove it*.
In 2025, we plan to sponsor **over 25 NuGet libraries** – and guess what? You’ve been selected as one of them!

👉 You can see the list of current sponsored packages here:
[https://zzzprojects.com/mission#sponsorship](https://zzzprojects.com/mission#sponsorship)

We’re mainly looking for **long-term sponsorships**.
As long as you keep supporting your package, we’ll keep supporting you 💪

A little story for you:

> Our company was actually started thanks to a big donation. When I received it, I said:
> **"Why not… let’s try to create my own company instead of working forever for somebody else!"** 😄
>
> And here we are today.

## 💸 How Sponsorship Works

We sponsor your GitHub repository — and in return, we ask for a little **visibility** for our libraries.
That way, it’s a **win-win**:

- You get support 💰
- We grow too 📈
- And the .NET community wins even more ❤️

If you're interested, let us know. Once everything is confirmed, we’ll offer you:

### ✅ What We Offer

- A **monthly sponsorship** (usually from $50 to $150 monthly)
   - Sometimes, we may offer a one-time payment for a **lifetime sponsorship**
- (Optional) Extra money 💵 to move your documentation to one of our websites:
   - [Learn Entity Framework Core](https://www.learnentityframeworkcore.com/)
   - [Learn Dapper](https://www.learndapper.com/)

#### Notes:

- All sponsorship amounts are **publicly disclosed**. Transparency first! (Nothing to hide here 😉)
- Payments are usually made through **GitHub Sponsors**. If GitHub doesn’t support your country, we’ll find another way.

## How to Add Us as a Sponsor

We’ll provide you with 2 images (one for **Dapper Plus**, one for **Entity Framework Extensions**).
Then, simply add a "Sponsors" section to your `README.md`:

```csharp
## Sponsors

[Entity Framework Extensions](https://entityframework-extensions.net/) and [Dapper Plus](https://dapper-plus.net/) are major sponsors and proud to contribute to the development of **YOUR LIBRARY NAME**.

[![Entity Framework Extensions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/[YourUserName]/[YourRepo]/[master or main]/entity-framework-extensions-sponsor.png)](https://entityframework-extensions.net/bulk-insert)

[![Dapper Plus](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/[YourUserName]/[YourRepo]/[master or main]/dapper-plus-sponsor.png)](https://dapper-plus.net/bulk-insert)
```

- 🔗 **Example**: [https://github.com/phnx47/dapper-repositories](https://github.com/phnx47/dapper-repositories)
- 📦 Add it on NuGet too: [https://www.nuget.org/packages/MicroOrm.Dapper.Repositories](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MicroOrm.Dapper.Repositories#readme-body-tab)

💡 Already have a sponsors section? Just add ours to it! Feel free to tweak the text to match your style.

### 🔗 URL Tag

Adding an URL tag is even better, it let us track performance. If you wish to do it, please use `utm` metadata in your sponsored links. Example:

Here is an example: 

```csharp
## Sponsors

[Entity Framework Extensions](https://entityframework-extensions.net/?utm_source=[your_name]&utm_medium=[content_type]) and [Dapper Plus](https://dapper-plus.net/?utm_source=[your_name]&utm_medium=[content_type]) are major sponsors and proud to contribute to the development of **YOUR LIBRARY NAME**.

[![Entity Framework Extensions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/[YourUserName]/[YourRepo]/[master or main]/entity-framework-extensions-sponsor.png)](https://entityframework-extensions.net/bulk-insert?utm_source=[your_name]&utm_medium=[content_type])

[![Dapper Plus](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/[YourUserName]/[YourRepo]/[master or main]/dapper-plus-sponsor.png)](https://dapper-plus.net/bulk-insert?utm_source=[your_name]&utm_medium=[content_type])
```

- [your_name]: Usually your github or nuget username
- [content_type]: Usually the package name

## Optional: Move Your Docs to Our Website

Want to host your docs on our platform? Totally optional — but here’s what we offer:

- We’ll write the **first version** using your current `README.md`
- You’ll be able to edit everything yourself via GitHub:
   - EF Core: [GitHub → learnentityframeworkcore.com](https://github.com/zzzprojects/docs/tree/master/learnentityframeworkcore.com/pages/extensions)
   - Dapper: [GitHub → learndapper.com](https://github.com/zzzprojects/docs/tree/master/learndapper.com/pages/extensions)
- 🔗 **Example**: [https://github.com/phnx47/dapper-repositories](https://github.com/phnx47/dapper-repositories)

### Your Side of the Task

- Trim your GitHub and NuGet readme to keep just the basics
- Add a line like: **"📘 Read more at [Learn Dapper](your-docs-url)"**
- Add the link in your **GitHub About section**
- Add the same link to the **"Project Website"** field on NuGet

---

## 🤝 Final Words

Let’s build a better .NET world — together 🧡

As long as:

- You keep maintaining your library
- We keep generating revenue

We’ll do our best to **keep supporting you**. That’s our promise.

We know how hard it can be to support open-source for free (especially when no one pays you 😅).

We hope this makes your life a bit easier — and gives you the motivation to continue giving more ❤️

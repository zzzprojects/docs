# Dedicated Articles Schedule

Below is the schedule of planned dedicated articles.

When you choose a date for your dedicated articles, follow these simple rules:

* **Keep at least 5 days between articles**:

  * No article should be scheduled within **5 days before** your article date.
  * No article should be scheduled within **5 days after** your article date.
  * Example: If your article is scheduled for **June 15**, the closest another article can be scheduled is **June 10** (before) or **June 20** (after).

* **Limit to one article every 2 months**:

  * This gives other content creators the chance to schedule their articles too.

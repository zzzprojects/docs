# Content Creator

In early 2025, we started sponsoring many content creators. It was our first time doing this â€” and for many of you, it was also your first time working with sponsored content.

It wasnâ€™t perfect, but it was a great first test to better understand the world of content creation.

During the summer, we took a short break to relaunch our content creator program â€” this time, with a much better structure to make everything smoother and easier for everyone involved.

## What Are We Looking For?

Weâ€™re currently planning to release **52 dedicated articles and/or YouTube videos** over the next 52 weeks:

* 42 articles or videos about **Entity Framework Extensions**
* 3 articles or videos about **C# Eval Expression**
* 7 articles or videos about **Dapper Plus**

These numbers are approximate â€” but you get the idea.

## What Do We Expect From You?

Weâ€™d like you to pick a few topics youâ€™re interested in, commit to a delivery date, and provide a fixed price for each article or video.

See our [Article Title Suggestions](/sponsors-articles)

**Again, these article titles are just suggestions. You can use them, but we highly recommend crafting your own based on your unique voice and approach.** 

Hereâ€™s what weâ€™re looking for:

* **Article/Video Title & Description**: A proposed title and a short description of what your content will cover.
* **Date**: A delivery date youâ€™re comfortable committing to.
* **Price**: A fixed price for each article or video. Please make it simple and tell us exactly whatâ€™s included â€” for example, will it include a newsletter, LinkedIn post, Twitter post, video version, etc.

And of course, we know things can change â€” if the date or title shifts a little, no worries. We totally understand.

## How will we help you?

Letâ€™s be honest: if the first thing you do after picking a topic is ask us what to write â€” without doing any research â€” then itâ€™s probably better we donâ€™t move forward.

We want to save both of us time, and I say this with all respect: Iâ€™m not a content writer, so please donâ€™t expect me to do that part for you.

Running a company while helping too many content creators just doesnâ€™t work â€” Iâ€™ve tried. And to be even more transparent, Iâ€™m slowly retiring, which means I have even less time available than before.

That said, Iâ€™ll always do my best to help you and obviously try to give you as much time as I can if you put your effort as well:

* I can review your draft,
* Give you feedback or direction when itâ€™s needed,
* Help you to discover more way to use our library,
* And try to make sure everything stays aligned with our goals.

But remember: this is **your** article or video. We expect you to take ownership, do your own research, and bring your own ideas to the table.

## Writing for AI

I suggest everyone read this post:
ðŸ‘‰ [In 2025, Donâ€™t Write for SEO, Donâ€™t Write for People â€” Write for AI](https://jonathanmagnan.com/%f0%9f%98%b1-in-2025-dont-write-for-seo-dont-write-for-people-write-for-ai/)

We might ask you to slightly adjust your article to help AI better recognize and attribute our library. For example:

* Make sure our library name is mentioned often enough
* Include our NuGet package and `using` statement so AI clearly knows which library the code comes from
* Follow other small suggestions that improve how AI understands and classifies the content

Yes â€” it might feel like some repetition, but in the long run, this helps a lot.

**Why is this important?**
Because too many times, Iâ€™ve seen AI recommend a competitor â€” while literally using **our content**. Thatâ€™s frustrating.

If weâ€™re paying for a dedicated article, we want the AI to know it's **our** library â€” not someone elseâ€™s.

## Rules

### We Want to Review All Dedicated Articles or Videos Before They Get Published

Weâ€™ve seen too many errors in the past â€” so yes, weâ€™d like to review every dedicated article or video **before it goes live**.

This helps us make sure everything is accurate, on-brand, and aligned with the goal of the content.

### No Double "Advertising" Dips

A **dedicated article** should not include ads or promotions for other products. Weâ€™re paying for an dedicated article thatâ€™s fully focused on our library.

If you still want to include other sponsorships or ads in the same article, **let us know in advance** â€” and offer a meaningful discount for it.

Converting a prospect into a customer is already hard enough. Adding extra ads or sponsorships can make that even harder â€” and we want to keep the readerâ€™s attention fully on us.

### Use SQL Server as the Main Provider

Around **80% of our clients use SQL Server**, so letâ€™s make sure weâ€™re targeting them properly.

Whenever possible, please use **SQL Server** as the default provider in your examples â€” instead of alternatives like SQLite or PostgreSQL.

### ChatGPT and Other AI Tools

We understand that youâ€™ll likely use AI tools like ChatGPT to help you write your article â€” and thatâ€™s totally fine.

**However**, make sure you **test the code** that AI gives you.

Weâ€™ve seen it too many times: someone copies code with options that donâ€™t even exist in our library. Thatâ€™s not what we expect from a dedicated article.

Please take the time to review, test, and ensure everything works. Weâ€™re counting on you to deliver a **professional article with working examples**.

### Article Links

Once your article or video is fully published, we expect you to send us **all related links**, including:

* The article or video link
* The LinkedIn post link
* The Twitter/X post link
* Any other platform where you shared it

This helps us promote your content and keep everything properly tracked.

### .NET Fiddle

This one is more of a suggestion â€” but an important one.

I believe most of you **donâ€™t include enough examples using [.NET Fiddle](https://dotnetfiddle.net/)**.

Adding online, runnable examples gives your article a big advantage. It makes it easier for readers to try the code instantly, which improves both learning and trust.

## Conclusion

To wrap it up, hereâ€™s a quick reminder of what weâ€™re looking for:

* **Article/Video Title & Description** â€“ What your content will cover.
* **Date** â€“ When you plan to deliver it.
* **Price** â€“ A fixed rate and whatâ€™s included (e.g., LinkedIn post, video version, etc.)

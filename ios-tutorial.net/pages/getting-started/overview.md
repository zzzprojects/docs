 - Many software developers are surprised how different it is to jump into the Apple developer world if it's not what they are used to.

So, in this step by step tutorials, we will explore not only the code, but the most important ideas, techniques, and skills that you will always need when doing any iOS development. After completing this step by step tutorial, you will;

 - Get comfortable with the Xcode 9 and the Swift 4 programming language. 
 - Cover how to create iOS projects. 
 - Build iOS user interfaces that can automatically adjust themselves to work on multiple devices, from the smallest iPhone to the largest iPad, and everything in between, including the latest iPhone X.

## Prerequisites

Before starting iOS development, the first and the most important thing you will need is a Mac running macOS High Sierra, or at least Sierra. 

 - In Apple development world, it is a good idea to be on the latest version of macOS. 
 - The second thing you will need is Xcode 9 installed on that Mac. 
 - It is assumed that you are familiar with the Swift programming language. You do not need to be a Swift master, but at least you can comfortably read and understand Swift code.

 - The latest stable release is version 9.2 and is available via the Mac App Store free of charge for macOS High Sierra and macOS Sierra users.
 - In the Apple developer world, everybody uses Xcode. 
 - Some developers might add additional tools, but there is no Lite or Pro or Enterprise editions, there's just one Xcode, it is free, and it includes everything for developing across all Apple platforms, such iOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS.
 - It includes all the features you need to design, develop, and debug an app. 
 - Xcode also contains the iOS SDK, which extends Xcode to include the tools, compilers, and frameworks you need specifically for iOS development.

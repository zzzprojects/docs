# EF Core Stored Procedure: Discover How to Use SP to Save Entities

## Introduction

The Entity Framework allows you to use stored procedures to perform predefined logic on database tables. Raw SQL queries can be used to execute a stored procedure. 

Here is a simple stored procedure, it will insert a customer record into a Customers table when executed.


```csharp
IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM sys.objects WHERE object_id = 
   OBJECT_ID(N'[dbo].[CreateCustomer]') AND type in (N'P', N'PC'))

BEGIN
    EXEC dbo.sp_executesql @statement = N'
    CREATE PROCEDURE [dbo].[CreateCustomer]
        @FirstName Varchar(50),
        @LastName Varchar(50),
        @Address Varchar(100)
    AS
    INSERT INTO dbo.Customers(
        [FirstName],
        [LastName],
        [Address]
    )
    VALUES (@FirstName, @LastName,@Address)
    '
END
GO
```

The `ExecuteSqlCommand()` method can be used to execute database commands as a string, and it will return the number of affected rows.


```csharp
using (var context = new MyContext())
{
    int affectedRows = context.Database.ExecuteSqlCommand("CreateCustomer @p0, @p1, @p2",
        parameters: new[] 
        {
            "Elizabeth",
            "Lincoln",
            "23 Tsawassen Blvd."
        });
}
```

Similarly, you can execute stored procedures for Update and Delete commands.

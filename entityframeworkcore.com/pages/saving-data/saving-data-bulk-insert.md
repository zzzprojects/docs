# EF Core Bulk Insert: Discover How to Insert Thousands of Entities

## Introduction

When you want to insert hundreds, thousands, or millions of entities using `SaveChanges()` method, you will notice that your application performance is **INSANELY** slow. Because `SaveChanges()` requires one database round-trip for every entity to insert. So if you need to insert 10000 entities, then 10000 database round-trips will be performed and your application suffers from performance issues.

Entity Framework Core has made great improvements and is way faster than EF6, but your application performance can be even faster than that by using a 3rd party library [Entity Framework Extensions](https://entityframework-extensions.net/).

### BulkInsert

Entity Framework Extensions provides an extension method [BulkInsert](https://entityframework-extensions.net/bulk-insert) which requires the minimum database round-trips as compared to `SaveChanges()`. For example, under the hood for SQL Server, a simple `SqlBulkCopy` could be performed.

#### Performance Comparisons

| Operations      | 1,000 Entities | 2,000 Entities | 5,000 Entities |
| :-------------- | -------------: | -------------: | -------------: |
| SaveChanges     | 1,000 ms       | 2,000 ms       | 5,000 ms       |
| BulkInsert      | 6 ms           | 10 ms          | 15 ms          |

#### Steps to use BulkInsert

 1. CREATE a list
 2. ADD entity to the list
 3. USE BulkInsert
 4. Done!


```csharp
using (var ctx = new CustomerContext())
{
    // 1. CREATE a list
    List<Customer> customers = new List<Customer>();
    
    foreach(var line in lines)
    {
        var customer = new Customer();
        // ...code...
        
        // 2. ADD entity to the list
        customers.Add(customer);
    }
    
    // 3. USE BulkInsert
    ctx.BulkInsert(customers);
    
    // 4. Done!
}
```

# EF Core Track Graph: Discover How to Set an Entity in Added or Modified State

## Introduction

Entity Framework Core provides different methods, like `Add`, `Attach`, and `Update` for entity graph-traversal and determine whether an entity should be marked as Added (to insert), Modified (to update), Unchanged (do nothing), or Deleted (to delete).

 - These methods work well for individual entities or in cases where you don't mind all properties being included in an UPDATE statement whether they were changed or not.
 - In Entity Framework Core, the ChangeTracker.TrackGraph() method was also introduced to track the entire entity graph and set custom entity states to each entity in a graph.

#### TrackGraph

`TrackGraph` method is designed for use in disconnected scenarios where entities are retrieved using one instance of the context and then changes are saved using a different instance of the context.

 - It starts tracking an entity and any entities that are reachable by traversing its navigation properties. 
 - Traversal is recursive, so the navigation properties of any discovered entities will also be scanned. 
 - The specified callback is called for each discovered entity and must set the State that each entity should be tracked in. If no state is set, the entity remains untracked.
 - If an entity is discovered that is already tracked by the context, that entity is not processed and its navigation properties are not traversed.

Here is a simple object graph.


```csharp
var customer = new Customer()
{
    CustomerId = 1,
    FirstName = "Elizabeth",
    LastName = "Lincoln",
    Address = "23 Tsawassen Blvd.",
    Invoices = new List<Invoice>()
    {
        new Invoice()
        {
            Id = 1,
            Date = new DateTime(2018, 1,2)
        },
        new Invoice()
        {
            Id =2,
            Date = new DateTime(2018, 1,23)
        }
    }
};
```

In this object graph, we have two invoices of a customer, and the Date property for both invoices has been changed. To update the database for the above object graph, we can use `Update()` method, and it will do the job. 


```csharp
using(var context = new MyContext())
{
    context.Update(customer);
    context.SaveChanges();
}
```

 - The Update method will mark the root entity and all its related entities as Modified. 
 - SQL will be generated to update all of their properties (whether they have been changed or not) to the values that have been assigned to the entities. 
 - That means that all of the values for all of the entities have to be present; otherwise, they will be overwritten with null or default values.

The `TrackGraph` method provides easy access to each entity in the graph.


```csharp
using (var context = new MyContext())
{
    context.ChangeTracker.TrackGraph(customer, e =>
    {
        e.Entry.State = EntityState.Unchanged;

        if((e.Entry.Entity as Invoice) != null)
        {
            if (e.Entry.IsKeySet)
            {
                e.Entry.State = EntityState.Modified;
            }
            else
            {
                e.Entry.State = EntityState.Added;
            }
        }
    });

    foreach (var entry in context.ChangeTracker.Entries())
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Entity: {0}, State: {1}", entry.Entity.GetType().Name, entry.State.ToString());
    }
    context.SaveChanges();
}
```

The TrackGraph method is new in Entity Framework Core and offers a simple way to iterate over a graph of objects that you want the context to begin tracking, and to apply customized code based on the type of entity and other criteria.

# Data Binding

In Blazor, you can bind data to both components and DOM elements using the `bind` attribute. 

 - Data binding is one of the most powerful features of software development technologies. 
 - It is the connection bridge between View and the business logic of the application. 

In Blazor, you can bind data in the following ways:

<ul>
	<li><a href="{{ site.github.url }}/one-way-data-binding">One-way Data Binding</a></li>
	<li><a href="{{ site.github.url }}/two-way-data-binding">Two-way Data Binding</a></li>
    <li><a href="{{ site.github.url }}/event-binding">Event Binding</a></li>
</ul>

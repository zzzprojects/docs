# Type not Supported

## Problem

You execute a method from the Entity Framework Extensions library, and the following error is thrown:

> Type not supported yet (LazyType): [TypeName]

### Cause

For some providers, we may have missed a few types. They are added on demand.

### Solution
Contact our support team with the provider & type name: <a href="mailto:info@zzzprojects.com">info@zzzprojects.com</a>

We usually fix and test this kind of issue within 24h

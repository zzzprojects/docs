# 📜 Logging options in EF Extensions

The `Logging` feature in Entity Framework Extensions lets you **capture and analyze SQL statements, parameters, and execution details** during [bulk operations](/bulk-extensions) with your EF Core context.

You can choose between two approaches:

- Use a **delegate (`Log`)** to handle log messages immediately as they are generated.
- Use a **`StringBuilder` (`LogDump`)** to collect all log messages when `UseLogDump` is enabled.

You can also use the `AddLogExecuting` and `AddLogExecuted` events to inspect the command associated with each log before and after it is executed.

## 🏷️ Log

The `Log` option in Entity Framework Extensions lets you **define an action** that runs whenever an "Information" log message is generated.

```csharp
// @nuget: Z.EntityFramework.Extensions.EFCore
using Z.EntityFramework.Extensions;
using System.Text;

// Example 1: Log into a StringBuilder
var sb = new StringBuilder();
context.BulkMerge(list, options =>
{
    options.Log = message => sb.AppendLine(message);
});
Console.WriteLine(sb.ToString());

// Example 2: Log directly to the console
context.BulkMerge(list, options =>
{
    options.Log = Console.WriteLine;
});
```

👉 Best for redirecting logs directly into custom handlers (e.g., **console output, files, or third-party logging frameworks**).

---

## 🏷️ LogDump + UseLogDump

The `LogDump` property is a `StringBuilder` that acts as a **container for log messages**.

To enable it, you must also set the `UseLogDump` property to `true`.

```csharp
// @nuget: Z.EntityFramework.Extensions.EFCore
using Z.EntityFramework.Extensions;
using System.Text;

var sb = new StringBuilder();

context.BulkMerge(list, options =>
{
    options.UseLogDump = true;  // Enable log dump
    options.LogDump = sb;       // Collect messages into StringBuilder
});

Console.WriteLine(sb.ToString());
```

👉 Best for scenarios where you want to **collect all log messages in one place** and review them after the operation completes.

---

## 🏷️ Intercept Commands During Logging

When loggin is enabled, you can use two events to inspect every logged command:

- **AddLogExecuting** runs immediately before the command is executed.
- **AddLogExecuted** runs immediately after the command is executed.

Both events receive the command as an `object` and the current log as a `StringBuilder`.

The command runtime type depends on the database provider and the current operation. For example, with SQL Server, it can be a `SqlCommand`, `SqlBulkCopy`, or another command type. You should always check its runtime type before using it.

```csharp
// @nuget: Z.EntityFramework.Extensions.EFCore
using Microsoft.Data.SqlClient;
using Z.EntityFramework.Extensions;

var sb = new StringBuilder();

context.BulkMerge(list, options =>
{
    options.UseLogDump = true;  // Enable log dump
    options.LogDump = sb;       // Collect messages into StringBuilder

    options.AddLogExecuting = (command, log) =>
    {
        if (command is SqlBulkCopy)
        {
            log.AppendLine("Executing a SqlBulkCopy operation.");
        }
        else if (command is SqlCommand sqlCommand)
        {
            log.AppendLine($"Executing command: {sqlCommand.CommandText}");
        }
    };

    options.AddLogExecuted = (command, log) =>
    {
        log.AppendLine($"Executed command type: {command.GetType().Name}");
    };
});
```

For more information, see [AddLogExecuting and AddLogExecuted](/events#addlogexecuting-and-addlogexecuted) on the Events page.

⚠️ **Warning:** Do not assume that the command is always a `DbCommand`. Some operations use provider-specific types such as `SqlBulkCopy`, which does not inherit from `DbCommand`.

## 🔎 Log vs LogDump

| Feature           | **Log** (`options.Log`)                                                     | **LogDump** (`options.LogDump + UseLogDump`)                  |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **How it works**  | Executes an action for each log message as it happens                       | Collects all messages into a `StringBuilder`                  |
| **When executed** | Real-time, during the operation                                             | After the operation finishes (messages available all at once) |
| **Best for**      | Redirecting messages to custom handlers (console, file, third-party logger) | Reviewing or debugging all messages at once                   |
| **Flexibility**   | High — you decide what to do with each message                              | Lower — limited to storing in `StringBuilder`                 |
| **Typical usage** | `options.Log = message => sb.AppendLine(message);`                                          | `options.UseLogDump = true; options.LogDump = sb;`            |

## 📌 When to Use

Logging is useful whenever you need to:

- Debug bulk operations by reviewing executed SQL.
- Capture logs for auditing or monitoring.
- Inspect commands before and after they are executed.
- Redirect SQL output into custom loggers like **NLog**, **Serilog**, or **log4net**.

---

## ⭐ Why It’s Useful

With logging you can:

- See what SQL is executed behind the scenes.
- Diagnose performance or parameter issues.
- Store executed SQL for debugging, testing, or compliance.

## Log Message Example

## Example 1 — Insert with Identity

Here we use the option `options.InsertKeepIdentity = true;` so our insert keeps the **identity values** we provide.

The log clearly shows what happened:

- `IDENTITY_INSERT` was turned **ON**, the 3 rows were inserted, then it was turned **OFF**.
- The exact **SQL command text** is displayed.
- Each **parameter value and type** is listed.
- The **command timeout**, **execution start and end time**, and the **number of results** are all logged.

```csharp
-- Executing Command:
SET IDENTITY_INSERT [EntitySimples] ON;
INSERT INTO [EntitySimples] 
( [ID], [ColumnString] )
SELECT [ID], [ColumnString]  
FROM (SELECT TOP 100 PERCENT * FROM (SELECT @0_0 AS [ID], @0_1 AS [ColumnString], @0_2 AS ZZZ_Index
UNION ALL SELECT @1_0 AS [ID], @1_1 AS [ColumnString], @1_2 AS ZZZ_Index
UNION ALL SELECT @2_0 AS [ID], @2_1 AS [ColumnString], @2_2 AS ZZZ_Index) AS StagingTable ORDER BY ZZZ_Index) AS StagingTable   
;
SET IDENTITY_INSERT [EntitySimples] OFF;
-- @0_0: 1 (Type = Int32, Size = 4)
-- @0_1: Entity Framework Extensions (Type = String, Size = -1)
-- @0_2: 0 (Type = Int32, Size = 0)
-- @1_0: 2 (Type = Int32, Size = 4)
-- @1_1: Dapper Plus (Type = String, Size = -1)
-- @1_2: 1 (Type = Int32, Size = 0)
-- @2_0: 3 (Type = Int32, Size = 4)
-- @2_1: C# Eval Expression (Type = String, Size = -1)
-- @2_2: 2 (Type = Int32, Size = 0)
-- CommandTimeout:0
-- Executing at 2025-08-19 10:25:21 AM
-- Completed at 2025-08-19 10:25:21 AM
-- Result: 3
```

### Example 2 — Bulk Insert with Staging Table

In this example, a **staging table** is created to perform a bulk insert. This is the default approach Entity Framework Extensions uses behind the scenes for many bulk operations.

The log shows each step of the process:

- Create a **temporary table** (`#ZZZProjects_...`) with the required columns.
- Create a **clustered index** on the staging table to improve performance.
- Use **`SqlBulkCopy`** to load data into the staging table.
- Execute a **`MERGE`** statement to insert rows into the destination table.
  * The `OUTPUT` clause is used here to return additional details.
- Log the **parameters** (`@IndexStart`, `@IndexEnd`) with their values and types.
- Log **timing information** and the **number of rows inserted**.
- Finally, **drop** the temporary table once the operation completes.

```csharp
-- Executing Command:
CREATE TABLE #ZZZProjects_5e417609_6377_4596_a517_6cf250906727 ( [ColumnString] nvarchar (max)  COLLATE SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AI NULL, [ID] [sys].[int] NULL, ZZZ_Index [INT] NOT NULL )

CREATE CLUSTERED INDEX [INDEX_#ZZZProjects_5e417609_6377_4596_a517_6cf250906727] ON #ZZZProjects_5e417609_6377_4596_a517_6cf250906727 (ZZZ_Index ASC);
-- CommandTimeout:0
-- Executing at 2025-08-19 10:27:44 AM
-- Completed at 2025-08-19 10:27:44 AM
-- Result: -1


SqlBulkCopy: #ZZZProjects_5e417609_6377_4596_a517_6cf250906727
-- BulkCopyTimeout:0
Executing at 2025-08-19 10:27:44 AM
Completed at 2025-08-19 10:27:44 AM


-- Executing Command:
MERGE INTO [EntitySimples]  AS DestinationTable
USING
(
SELECT TOP 100 PERCENT * FROM #ZZZProjects_5e417609_6377_4596_a517_6cf250906727
WHERE ZZZ_Index >= @IndexStart AND ZZZ_Index <= @IndexEnd ORDER BY ZZZ_Index
) AS StagingTable
ON 1 = 2
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN
    INSERT ( [ColumnString] )
    VALUES ( [ColumnString] )
OUTPUT
    $action,
    StagingTable.ZZZ_Index,
    INSERTED.[ID] AS [ID_zzzinserted]


;
-- @IndexStart: 0 (Type = Int32, Size = 0)
-- @IndexEnd: 2 (Type = Int32, Size = 0)
-- CommandTimeout:0
-- Executing at 2025-08-19 10:27:44 AM
-- Completed at 2025-08-19 10:27:44 AM
-- Result: 3 rows


-- Executing Command:
DROP TABLE #ZZZProjects_5e417609_6377_4596_a517_6cf250906727;
-- CommandTimeout:0
-- Executing at 2025-08-19 10:27:44 AM
-- Completed at 2025-08-19 10:27:44 AM
-- Result: -1

# Rows Affected

## RowsAffected

Getting the number of rows affected might be useful to know how many entities have been inserted, for example.

It's possible to get this information by enabling the option `UseRowsAffected = true`. Enabling this option is required since it slightly decreases the performance.

You can find the number of rows affected in the `ResultInfo` class:

- ResultInfo
   - RowsAffected
   - RowsAffectedInserted
   - RowsAffectedUpdated
   - RowsAffectedDeleted
   - RowsAffectedSoftDeleted

```csharp
var resultInfo = new Z.BulkOperations.ResultInfo();

context.BulkSaveChanges(options => {
	options.UseRowsAffected = true;
	options.ResultInfo = resultInfo;
});
```

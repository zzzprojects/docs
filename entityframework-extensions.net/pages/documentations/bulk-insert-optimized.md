# Bulk Insert Optimized /n Instantly maximize your insert performance in EF Core 9

The `BulkInsertOptimized` method is the fastest way you can insert entities in EF Core. By default, it uses the most optimal SQL because it doesn't return any values unless you explicitly request them. This approach lets it skip the additional steps required by our [BulkInsert](/bulk-insert) method, making it even faster.

```csharp
// @nuget: Z.EntityFramework.Extensions.EFCore
using Z.EntityFramework.Extensions;

// Easy to use
context.BulkInsertOptimized(customers);

// Easy to customize
context.BulkInsertOptimized(invoices, options => options.IncludeGraph = true);
```

**What advantages does `BulkInsertOptimized` have over `BulkInsert`?**  
One key advantage is that `BulkInsertOptimized` can use the `BulkCopy` strategy directly into the destination table instead of creating a temporary table to handle output values. This removes an extra step and boosts performance.  

Another benefit is that it can suggest best practices for optimal performance, ensuring the most efficient use of `BulkCopy`.

**What disadvantages does `BulkInsertOptimized` have over `BulkInsert`?**  
Because `BulkInsertOptimized` doesn’t return values, the `IncludeGraph` option isn’t compatible with models that rely on database-generated keys like identities.

## What are the performance gains when not outputting values

Below is a benchmark showing the performance for a list of `Customer` with the `CustomerID` as an identity value:

| Operations      		| 1,000 Entities | 2,000 Entities | 5,000 Entities |
| :-------------------- | -------------: | -------------: | -------------: |
| BulkInsert     		| 220 ms       	 | 330 ms         | 600 ms         |
| BulkInsertOptimized   | 100 ms         | 150 ms         | 250 ms         |

Both are extremely fast, but the `BulkInsertOptimized` will always be faster due to not having to output values.

## Recommendations and Performance Hints

The `BulkInsertOptimized` method returns an instance of `BulkOptimizedAnalysis`.

```csharp
// @nuget: Z.EntityFramework.Extensions.EFCore
using Z.EntityFramework.Extensions;

public class BulkOptimizedAnalysis 
{
    /// <summary>True if the bulk insert is optimized.</summary>
    public bool IsOptimized { get; }

    /// <summary>Gets a text containing all tips to optimize the bulk insert method.</summary>
    public string TipsText { get; }
    
    /// <summary>Gets a list of tips to optimize the bulk insert method.</summary>
    public List<string> Tips { get; }
}
```

In short:

- **IsOptimized:** returns true if the bulk insert is optimized.
- **Tips:** when the bulk insert is not optimized, it will return all reasons found.
- **TipsText:** will provide all tips but in a single string.

To better understand how this class works, let's take the following [online example](https://dotnetfiddle.net/FZJSnE):

```csharp
// example 1
var analysis = context.BulkInsertOptimized(customers);

// example 2
var analysis = context.BulkInsertOptimized(customers, options => {
				options.InsertIfNotExists = true;
			});
```

The "example 1" is optimized. For SQL Server, for example, a `SqlBulkCopy` can be directly used.

The "example 2" is not considered as optimized. For SQL Server, we cannot directly use a `SqlBulkCopy` to insert if the row doesn't already exist. It requires some additional logic involving a temporary table. The following tip is returned: "The option `InsertIfNotExists = true` forces the use of a less efficient strategy, resulting in a considerable performance penalty."

## Limitations

## Conclusion

The `BulkInsertOptimized` method is a powerful tool, yet it is very similar to [`BulkInsert`](/bulk-insert). As specified, the major difference lies in the fact that `BulkInsertOptimized` does not automatically output values. Instead, it returns a `BulkOptimizedAnalysis`, which informs you whether the strategy employed for insertion is the most efficient, and explains the reasons when it is not.

# üóëÔ∏è‚ùì Delete Matched and Condition Option in Entity Framework Extensions /n Delete only when source and destination values match

The `DeleteMatchedAndCondition` option in Entity Framework Extensions lets you **perform the `DELETE` action only when certain values in the source and destination are equal**.  

If the selected values don‚Äôt match, the delete is skipped. This is useful whenever you need more control over which rows get deleted ‚Äî for example to **avoid removing newer records, protect versioned data, or enforce simple concurrency checks**.  

```csharp
// @nuget: Z.EntityFramework.Extensions.EFCore
using Z.EntityFramework.Extensions;

context.BulkDelete(customers, options => 
{
    // ON DELETE: only delete customers if "Version" has the same value in both source and destination
    options.DeleteMatchedAndConditionExpression = x => new { x.Version };
});
````

Typical scenarios include:

* **Row version (`Version`)** ‚Üí Delete a record only if the version is the same in both source and destination (lightweight concurrency check).
* **Approval flag (`IsApproved`)** ‚Üí Prevent deleting rows already approved by another process.
* **Status (`Status`)** ‚Üí Only delete if both sides are marked as `Inactive`, avoiding accidental removal of active data.
* **Audit protection** ‚Üí Ensure rows are deleted only when both match the expected audit values.

This option applies to the following method in Entity Framework Extensions:

* [BulkDelete](/bulk-delete)

## üí° Example Effect

| **ID** | **Destination.Version** | **Source.Version** | **Without Condition** | **With Condition** |
| ------ | ----------------------- | ------------------ | --------------------- | ------------------ |
| 1      | 1                       | 1                  | deleted             | deleted          |
| 2      | 2                       | 3                  | deleted             | skipped          |
| 3      | 4                       | 2                  | deleted             | skipped          |

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

Before continuing, we recommend reading these articles first to understand **how EF Extensions options work** and the **differences between column option types**:

* [Configure Options](/configure-options) ‚Äì Learn the basics of setting and customizing options in EF Extensions.
* [Configure Column Options](/configure-column-options) ‚Äì See how to configure column-specific behavior and when to use `Expression` (strongly typed, compile-time safe) vs. `Names` (string-based, dynamic at runtime).

---

## üìå When to Use

Use the `DeleteMatchedAndCondition` option from Entity Framework Extensions when:

* You want to **skip deletes for certain records** based on business rules
* Deletes should happen **only when both source and destination values match**
* Primary key filtering alone is not enough, and you need finer control

---

## ‚≠ê Why It‚Äôs Useful

Without `DeleteMatchedAndCondition`, using in EF Core a [BulkDelete](/bulk-delete) from Entity Framework Extensions could accidentally **remove rows that should not be deleted**.

Using this option, you can:

* Prevent unwanted deletions of newer or protected data
* Enforce concurrency rules without complex SQL
* Simplify your logic and keep your database safe

---

## üè¢ Scenario

A company imports in EF Core customers using [BulkDelete](/bulk-delete) method from Entity Framework Extensions.

In the example, customers have a `Version` column:

* If the **Version values are equal** ‚Üí the customer can be deleted
* If the **Version values differ** ‚Üí the customer must remain in the database

This ensures that only outdated or expected records are deleted, protecting against accidental removal of updated rows.

Other common cases include:

* Deleting orders only if the **Status values** are the same in both systems
* Deleting records only if the **IsApproved flag** is unchanged
* Deleting entities only when **Version values** match, preventing loss of concurrent changes

---

### üóùÔ∏è Solution

The `DeleteMatchedAndCondition` option offers **four ways** to configure behavior:

* **[DeleteMatchedAndConditionExpression](#deletematchedandconditionexpression)** ‚Äì include properties via a lambda expression
* **[DeleteMatchedAndConditionNames](#deletematchedandconditionnames)** ‚Äì include properties via a list of property names
* **[IgnoreOnDeleteMatchedAndConditionExpression](#ignoreondeletematchedandconditionexpression)** ‚Äì exclude properties via a lambda expression, all others properties are included.
* **[IgnoreOnDeleteMatchedAndConditionNames](#ignoreondeletematchedandconditionnames)** ‚Äì exclude properties via a list of property names, all others properties are included.

## üè∑Ô∏è DeleteMatchedAndConditionExpression

Use this option to specify ‚Äî with a **lambda expression** ‚Äî which property values must be **equal in both source and destination** for the `DELETE` to occur.

If all selected property values match, the delete is executed. Otherwise, it is skipped.

```csharp
context.BulkDelete(customers, options => 
{
    // ON DELETE: remove customers only when "Version" values are equal in both source and destination
    options.DeleteMatchedAndConditionExpression = x => new { x.Version };
});
```

| Method     | Option Name                         | Try it                                            |

## üè∑Ô∏è DeleteMatchedAndConditionNames

Use this option to specify ‚Äî with a **list of property names** ‚Äî which property values must be **equal in both source and destination** for the `DELETE` to occur.

If all selected property values match, the delete is executed. Otherwise, it is skipped.

```csharp
context.BulkDelete(customers, options => 
{
    // ON DELETE: perform delete only when "Version" values are equal in both source and destination
    options.DeleteMatchedAndConditionNames = new List<string>() { nameof(Customer.Version) };
});
```

## üè∑Ô∏è IgnoreOnDeleteMatchedAndConditionExpression

Use this option to specify ‚Äî with a **lambda expression** ‚Äî which property values should be **excluded from the equality check**.

All other property values (not listed) will be compared between source and destination. The `DELETE` will only happen if those remaining values are equal.

```csharp
context.BulkDelete(customers, options => 
{
    // ON DELETE: remove customer only when all values except these are equal
    options.IgnoreOnDeleteMatchedAndConditionExpression = x => new { x.CustomerID, x.Name, x.Email, x.Note };
});
```

| Method     | Option Name                                 | Try it                                            |

## üè∑Ô∏è IgnoreOnDeleteMatchedAndConditionNames

Use this option to specify ‚Äî with a **list of property names** ‚Äî which values should be **excluded from the equality check**.

All other values (not listed) will be compared between source and destination. The `DELETE` will only happen if those remaining values are equal.

```csharp
context.BulkDelete(customers, options => 
{
    // ON DELETE: remove customer only when all values except these are equal
    options.IgnoreOnDeleteMatchedAndConditionNames = new List<string>() 
    { 
        nameof(Customer.CustomerID), nameof(Customer.Name), nameof(Customer.Email), nameof(Customer.Note) 
    };
});
```

# üóëÔ∏è‚ùì Delete Matched and One NOT Condition Option in Entity Framework Extensions /n Delete only when at least one value is different

The `DeleteMatchedAndOneNotCondition` option in Entity Framework Extensions lets you **perform the `DELETE` action only when at least one selected value in the source and destination is different**.  

If all selected values are equal, the delete is skipped. This is useful when you want to **protect certain records, enforce rules, or avoid removing entries that are still valid**.  

```csharp
// @nuget: Z.EntityFramework.Extensions.EFCore
using Z.EntityFramework.Extensions;

context.BulkDelete(customers, options => 
{
    // ON DELETE: only remove if "Version" is different between source and destination
    options.DeleteMatchedAndOneNotConditionExpression = x => new { x.Version };
});
````

Typical scenarios include:

* **Versioning (`Version`)** ‚Üí Only delete if the record version differs, preventing accidental removal of up-to-date records.
* **Approval checks (`ApprovedBy`, `ApprovedDate`)** ‚Üí Protect approved records from deletion unless one of these values changes.
* **Synchronization rules (`SyncKey`, `LastSyncDate`)** ‚Üí Delete only when a mismatch indicates outdated or invalid records.
* **User profiles (`Email`, `Role`)** ‚Üí Avoid deleting active users unless at least one critical field differs.

This option applies to the following methods in Entity Framework Extensions:

* [BulkDelete](/bulk-delete)

## üí° Example Effect

| **ID** | **Destination.Version** | **Source.Version** | **Without Condition** | **With Condition** |
| ------ | ----------------------- | ------------------ | --------------------- | ------------------ |
| 1      | 1                       | 1                  | deleted             | skipped          |
| 2      | 3                       | 4                  | deleted             | deleted          |
| 3      | 5                       | 5                  | deleted             | skipped          |

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

Before continuing, we recommend reading these articles first to understand **how EF Extensions options work** and the **differences between column option types**:

* [Configure Options](/configure-options) ‚Äì Learn the basics of setting and customizing options in EF Extensions.
* [Configure Column Options](/configure-column-options) ‚Äì See how to configure column-specific behavior and when to use `Expression` (strongly typed, compile-time safe) vs. `Names` (string-based, dynamic at runtime).

---

## üìå When to Use

Use the `DeleteMatchedAndOneNotCondition` option from Entity Framework Extensions when:

* You want to **delete only if at least one key field is different**
* You need to **protect records from being deleted if nothing meaningful has changed**
* You want to **enforce rules on deletions during synchronization or imports**

---

## ‚≠ê Why It‚Äôs Useful

Without `DeleteMatchedAndOneNotCondition`, using in EF Core a [BulkDelete](/bulk-delete) from Entity Framework Extensions could **remove rows unnecessarily**, even when the values are still valid.

Using this option, you can:

* Prevent unwanted deletions
* Protect important or approved records
* Keep synchronization logic simpler without custom SQL

---

## üè¢ Scenario

A company imports in EF Core customers using [BulkDelete](/bulk-delete) method from Entity Framework Extensions.

* Records should only be deleted if the `Version` field is different between source and destination.
* If versions match, the row should stay untouched.

In summary:

* If `Version` differs ‚Üí delete the customer
* If `Version` is the same ‚Üí skip deletion

---

### üóùÔ∏è Solution

The `DeleteMatchedAndOneNotCondition` option offers **four ways** to configure behavior:

* **[DeleteMatchedAndOneNotConditionExpression](#deletematchedandonenotconditionexpression)** ‚Äì include properties via a lambda expression
* **[DeleteMatchedAndOneNotConditionNames](#deletematchedandonenotconditionnames)** ‚Äì include properties via a list of property names
* **[IgnoreOnDeleteMatchedAndOneNotConditionExpression](#ignoreondeletematchedandonenotconditionexpression)** ‚Äì exclude properties via a lambda expression, all others properties are included.
* **[IgnoreOnDeleteMatchedAndOneNotConditionNames](#ignoreondeletematchedandonenotconditionnames)** ‚Äì exclude properties via a list of property names, all others properties are included.

## üè∑Ô∏è DeleteMatchedAndOneNotConditionExpression

Use this option to specify ‚Äî with a **lambda expression** ‚Äî which property values should be compared.
If at least one property value is different, the delete is executed.

```csharp
context.BulkDelete(customers, options => 
{
    options.DeleteMatchedAndOneNotConditionExpression = x => new { x.Version };
});
```

| Method     | Option Name                               | Try it                                            |

## üè∑Ô∏è DeleteMatchedAndOneNotConditionNames

Use this option to specify ‚Äî with a **list of property names** ‚Äî which property values should be compared.
If at least one property value is different, the delete is executed.

```csharp
context.BulkDelete(customers, options => 
{
    options.DeleteMatchedAndOneNotConditionNames = new List<string>() 
    { 
        nameof(Customer.Version) 
    };
});
```

| Method     | Option Name                          | Try it                                            |

## üè∑Ô∏è IgnoreOnDeleteMatchedAndOneNotConditionExpression

Use this option to specify ‚Äî with a **lambda expression** ‚Äî which property values should be excluded from comparison.
All other property values will be checked, and if at least one is different, the delete is executed.

```csharp
context.BulkDelete(customers, options => 
{
    options.IgnoreOnDeleteMatchedAndOneNotConditionExpression = x => new { x.CustomerID, x.Name, x.Email, x.Note };
});
```

| Method     | Option Name                                       | Try it                                            |

## üè∑Ô∏è IgnoreOnDeleteMatchedAndOneNotConditionNames

Use this option to specify ‚Äî with a **list of property names** ‚Äî which property values should be excluded from comparison.
All other property values will be checked, and if at least one is different, the delete is executed.

```csharp
context.BulkDelete(customers, options => 
{
    options.IgnoreOnDeleteMatchedAndOneNotConditionNames = new List<string>() 
    { 
        nameof(Customer.CustomerID), nameof(Customer.Name), nameof(Customer.Email), nameof(Customer.Note) 
    };
});
```

| Method     | Option Name                                  | Try it                                            |

## üèÅ Conclusion

Using `DeleteMatchedAndOneNotCondition` option in Entity Framework Extensions with EF Core ensures that **deletions only happen when at least one important value is different** between source and destination.

You can choose:

* **Expression-based include** ‚Üí `DeleteMatchedAndOneNotConditionExpression`
* **Name-based include** ‚Üí `DeleteMatchedAndOneNotConditionNames`
* **Expression-based exclude** ‚Üí `IgnoreOnDeleteMatchedAndOneNotConditionExpression`
* **Name-based exclude** ‚Üí `IgnoreOnDeleteMatchedAndOneNotConditionNames`

By using `DeleteMatchedAndOneNotCondition` in your [bulk operations](/bulk-extensions), you can:

* Skip unnecessary deletions when values match
* Protect sensitive or important records
* Keep synchronization safer and more predictable

# Bulk Insert /n Boost your EF Core insert performance now

The `BulkInsert` method is the easiest way you can insert thousands of entities in EF Core. In addition to being super fast, you can also customize it with various [options](/bulk-insert#bulk-insert-options) to insert entities the way you want—such as keeping identity values, inserting only entities that don't already exist in the database, and much more.

```csharp
// @nuget: Z.EntityFramework.Extensions.EFCore
using Z.EntityFramework.Extensions;

// Easy to use
context.BulkInsert(customers);

// Easy to customize
context.BulkInsert(invoices, options => options.IncludeGraph = true);
```

If you want to insert entities in EF Core even faster, you can use the [BulkInsertOptimized](/bulk-insert-optimized) method. The major difference between the two methods is:

- **BulkInsert:** By default, `AutoMapOutputDirection = true`, so it returns values like the identity value. This requires additional logic and can result in a less optimized SQL statement.
- **BulkInsertOptimized:** By default, `AutoMapOutputDirection = false`, so it does not return any values unless you explicitly specify otherwise.

## 🚀 Performance Comparison

A very popular search on Google is **"Fastest way to Bulk Insert in EF Core"**—and that’s exactly what our library delivers!

Don't just take our word for it or blindly trust what we say. Instead, try it yourself using our online benchmark and see the results with a single click!

### EF Core vs EFE

The `SaveChanges` method in EF Core is much faster than it was back in the EF6 days when inserting data. Why the improvement? The EF Core team introduced a new approach using a `MERGE` statement with a `RETURNING` clause—similar to the one we’ve been using for SQL Server since 2014. So yes, we were already doing something right!

Even with this new strategy, our library is still faster. That’s because we use `SqlBulkCopy` and have deeply optimized how data is handled behind the scenes. In fact, the performance gap becomes even more noticeable when your entities have more than just a few properties. If your entity only has 2 or 3 properties—like a very simple `Customer` with just `Id`, `Name`, and `Email`—the difference might seem smaller. But once you deal with real-world entities containing 10, 15, or more properties, **our optimized approach truly shines**.


| Operation                           | 1,000 Entities | 2,000 Entities | 5,000 Entities |
| :---------------------------------- | -------------: | -------------: | -------------: |
| SaveChanges                         | 325 ms         | 575 ms         | 1,400 ms       |
| BulkInsert (Outputting values)      | 60 ms          | 90 ms          | 150 ms         |
| BulkInsert (Not Outputting values)  | 30 ms          | 50 ms          | 90 ms          |
| BulkInsertOptimized                 | 30 ms          | 50 ms          | 90 ms          |

In other words, to save 5,000 entities:
- **BulkInsert (Outputting values)** is about **9x faster**, reducing insert time by **89%**.
- **BulkInsert (Not Outputting values)** is about **15x faster**, reducing insert time by **94%**.

Our library provides the best performance when no data needs to be returned/outputted. That’s why we introduced the `AutoMapOutputDirection = false` option and the [BulkInsertOptimized](/bulk-insert-optimized) method.

### EF Core vs EFE + Include Graph

Another important benchmark for EF Core is when inserting data that includes a graph of related entities. Being faster is one big advantage we offer—but just as important, our library uses only a **fraction of the memory**.

For example, when working with millions of entities, EF Core might use up to **2,000 MB**, while our library needs only around **400 MB**. That’s a huge difference, especially in memory-constrained environments.

In this benchmark, each **Order** entity includes **5 OrderItems**. We use `IncludeGraph` to automatically handle related entities during the insert—so you don’t need to manually insert children or worry about setting their foreign keys.

| Operation                           | 1,000 Entities | 2,000 Entities | 5,000 Entities |
| :---------------------------------- | -------------: | -------------: | -------------: |
| SaveChanges                         | 1,475 ms       | 2,600 ms       | 6,500 ms       |
| BulkInsert + IncludeGraph           | 260 ms         | 450 ms         | 900 ms         |
| BulkInsertOptimized + IncludeGraph  | 200 ms         | 350 ms         | 800 ms         |

👉 [Try our Online Benchmark](https://dotnetfiddle.net/xD6Bxk)

⚠️ On .NET Fiddle, you won’t be able to run `SaveChanges` with more than around **1,800 entities** before it crashes due to memory limits. But if you **comment out** the `SaveChanges` call, you’ll see that our library handles **5,000 entities** just fine. This helps prove an important point: performance isn’t only about speed—**memory usage matters too**.

### EF6 vs EFE

In EF6, the `SaveChanges` method makes one database round-trip for every entity it needs to insert. If you have hundreds or thousands of entities, our library is a must-have for this version. Otherwise, you're making your users wait forever for the save to complete.

| Operation                            | 1,000 Entities | 2,000 Entities | 5,000 Entities |
| :----------------------------------- | -------------: | -------------: | -------------: |
| SaveChanges                          | 1,000 ms       | 2,000 ms       | 5,000 ms       |
| BulkInsert (Outputting values)       | 90 ms          | 115 ms         | 150 ms         |
| BulkInsert (Not Outputting values)   | 30 ms          | 35 ms          | 60 ms          |

👉 [Try our Online Benchmark](https://dotnetfiddle.net/pSpD10)

In other words, to save 5,000 entities:
- **BulkInsert (Outputting values)** is about **30x faster**, reducing insert time by **97%**.
- **BulkInsert (Not Outputting values)** is about **85x faster**, reducing insert time by **99%**.

## Bulk Insert Options

### Configuring Options

We already saw in a previous article [Configuring Options](/configure-options) how to pass options to the `BulkInsert` method — but here’s a quick recap:

```csharp
// @nuget: Z.EntityFramework.Extensions.EFCore
using Z.EntityFramework.Extensions;

// Using a lambda expression (only works with one option)
context.BulkInsert(list, options => options.InsertKeepIdentity = true);

// Using a lambda expression with a body (works with one or multiple options)
context.BulkInsert(list, options =>
{
    options.InsertKeepIdentity = true;
    options.ColumnPrimaryKeyExpression = x => new { x.ID };
});

// Using a `BulkOperationOption` instance
var options = context.CreateBulkOptions<EntitySimple>();
options.InsertKeepIdentity = true;
options.ColumnPrimaryKeyExpression = x => new { x.ID };

context.BulkInsert(list, options);
```

> 💡 Tip: Using a `BulkOperationOption` instance is useful when you want to reuse the same configuration across multiple operations or keep your setup code more organized.

### Common Options

- Bulk Insert Behavior
   - **InsertIfNotExists:** Set to `true` if you only want to insert entities that don’t already exist in your database.
   - **InsertKeepIdentity:** Set to `true` if you want to insert entities with their identity value. For SQL Server, the library will automatically handle the `SET IDENTITY_INSERT [tableName] ON` and `SET IDENTITY_INSERT [tableName] OFF` commands.
   - **InsertNotMatchedAndFormula:** Specify a hardcoded SQL if you want to add custom logic to filter which rows should be inserted.
   - **InsertPrimaryKeyAndFormula:** Specify a hardcoded SQL to include additional logic—along with the primary key—to check if the entity matches an existing row in the database. Only rows that also match the formula will be inserted. This option usually only makes sense when `InsertIfNotExists = true`.
   - **InsertStagingTableFilterFormula:** Specify a hardcoded SQL if you want to filter which rows should be inserted using a staging table.
- Behavior
   - **AutoTruncate:** Set to `true` if you want string values to be automatically truncated to match the maximum database length before being inserted. This option is especially useful because `SqlCommand` and `SqlBulkCopy` can behave differently when a string is too long. (See [Issue #333](https://github.com/zzzprojects/EntityFramework-Extensions/issues/333#issuecomment-1041494634))
   - **ExplicitValueResolutionMode:** Specify how explicit values for columns (that aren’t usually expected to be set) should be handled. In EF Core, these values are always inserted. In EF Extensions, you need to tell how you want to handle them. [Learn more here](https://entityframework-extensions.net/explicit-value-resolution-mode)
   - **IncludeGraph:** Set to `true` if you want to insert both the main entities and their related entities. For example, if you pass a list of `Order` that includes `OrderItem`, both will be inserted. Be careful: if you want to apply specific options to a related entity type, you’ll need to configure them using `IncludeGraphBuilder`.
   - **IncludeGraphBuilder:** Required only if `IncludeGraph = true` **and** you need to customize how a related entity type is inserted. Use a lambda expression to control how each entity in the graph should be inserted — for example, to define how child entities are linked to their parent or how IDs should be propagated.
- Properties & Columns
   - **ColumnInputExpression:** Choose which properties should be inserted by using a lambda expression to select them. All other properties will be ignored.
   - **ColumnInputNames:** Choose which properties should be inserted by using a list of strings to select them. All other properties will be ignored.
   - **ColumnPrimaryKeyExpression:** Choose which properties should be part of the key by using a lambda expression. Only rows that match the key will be inserted. This option only works when `InsertIfNotExists = true`.
   - **ColumnPrimaryKeyNames:** Choose which properties should be part of the key by using a list of strings. Only rows that match the key will be inserted. This option only works when `InsertIfNotExists = true`.
   - **IgnoreOnInsertExpression:** Choose which properties should be ignored by using a lambda expression to select them. All other properties will be inserted.
   - **IgnoreOnInsertNames:** Choose which properties should be ignored by using a list of strings to select them. All other properties will be inserted.
- Optimization
   - **AutoMapOutputDirection:** Set to `false` to disable the default output mapping. This can dramatically improve performance when you don’t need to retrieve values normally returned by the database (like identity, computed, or default values). Alternatively, you can use the [BulkInsertOptimized](/bulk-insert-optimized) method for even faster inserts.
   - **Batch:** Customize the `BatchSize`, `BatchTimeout`, and `BatchDelayInterval` to improve performance and control how inserts are grouped and executed.
   - **Hint:** Use `QueryHint` or `TableHintSql` to apply SQL hints for additional performance tuning.
   - **UseTableLock:** Set to `true` to lock the destination table during the insert operation, which can improve performance by reducing row-level locks and avoiding lock escalation. This is especially useful when inserting a large number of rows.
- Providers Specific
   - **UsePostgreSqlInsertOnConflictDoNothing:** Set to `true` if you want to silently ignore any conflict that would otherwise trigger a constraint violation error, such as a duplicate key.
   - **UsePostgreSqlInsertOverridingSystemValue:** Set to `true` if you want the values provided in the `INSERT` statement to take precedence over any default values defined at the database level for system columns. This is useful when you need to insert explicit values for columns like timestamps that are normally managed by the database.
   - **UsePostgreSqlInsertOverridingUserValue:** Set to `true` if you want the values in the `INSERT` statement to override any user-defined default values set at the database level. This is helpful when you want the application's data to take priority — especially during automated or bulk inserts.
   - **SqlBulkCopyOptions:** Specify the default options to use when `SqlBulkCopy` is used to insert directly into the destination table (SQL Server only).  
  Default value: `(int)(DynamicSqlBulkCopyOptions.FireTriggers | DynamicSqlBulkCopyOptions.CheckConstraints)`
- General
   - **Audit:** Track inserted entities by using the `UseAudit` and `AuditEntries` options. [Learn more here](/audit)
   - **FutureAction:** Batch multiple insert operations and execute them later using the `ExecuteFuture` or `ExecuteFutureAsync` methods.
   - **Log:** Log all executed SQL statements using the `Log`, `UseLogDump`, and `LogDump` options. [Learn more here](/logging)
   - **RowsAffected:** Use `UseRowsAffected = true`, then access `ResultInfo.RowsAffected` or `ResultInfo.RowsAffectedInserted` to get the number of entities inserted. [Learn more here](/rows-affected)

## Troubleshooting

### Explicit Value Not Inserted

A major difference between `BulkInsert` and `SaveChanges` is how explicit values are handled.

In EF6, explicit values were always ignored—even if you specified a value for a column with a default value. However, EF Core changed this behavior and now automatically inserts the value you specify.

By default, our library still follows the same logic we used for EF6. But don’t worry—you can get the same behavior as EF Core by using the [ExplicitValueResolutionMode](/explicit-value-resolution-mode#explicitvalueresolutionmode) option.

Here’s how you can do it:

```csharp
// @nuget: Z.EntityFramework.Extensions.EFCore
using Z.EntityFramework.Extensions;

context.BulkInsert(customers, options => { 
		options.ExplicitValueResolutionMode = Z.EntityFramework.Extensions.ExplicitValueResolutionMode.SmartDefaultValueOnBulkInsert;
	});
```

## Limitations

### Hidden Navigation (EF6 only)

The `BulkInsert` method doesn’t rely on the `ChangeTracker` by default to maximize performance — unless there’s no other option.

For example, let’s say you want to insert a list of `InvoiceItem`, but there’s no direct navigation property or relation set toward the parent `Invoice`. In this case, you’ll need to add the parent entities to the `ChangeTracker`. This helps EF find and link the related `Invoice` for each `InvoiceItem`.

```csharp
// @nuget: Z.EntityFramework.Extensions.EFCore
using Z.EntityFramework.Extensions;

try
{
    context.BulkInsert(items);
}
catch
{
    Console.WriteLine("An error is thrown because the Invoice relation cannot be found.");
}

context.Invoices.AddRange(invoices);

// The ChangeTracker is used in this case
context.BulkInsert(items);
```

## Conclusion

The `BulkInsert` method is one of our most popular features. As we showed in this article, it doesn’t just offer better performance than `SaveChanges` — it also gives you access to many options that let you insert data exactly the way you want.

# Delete By Key

The `DeleteByKey` is a `DbSet<TEntity>` extension method that deletes an entity by using the value from an existing entity or directly key values. 

 - It is a direct operation and doesn't require calling SaveChanges.
 - The entity must exist in the database before this method is called.
 
```csharp
var key = customers.FirstOrDefault().CustomerID;
context.Customers.DeleteByKey(key);
            
var customer = context.Customers.FirstOrDefault();
context.Customers.DeleteByKey(customer);
```
 
[Try it](https://dotnetfiddle.net/AtVQZj)
 
In this example, the first customer is deleted by specifying its key, and then another customer is deleted based on the entity itself from the database. 

## Anonymous Type

You can pass an anonymous type as a parameter to delete an entity. 

```csharp
var anonymousType = new { CustomerID = 1 };
context.Customers.DeleteByKey(anonymousType);
```

## Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)

You can also specify the DTO object to delete an entity.

```csharp
var customerDTO = context.Customers
    .Select(c => new CustomerDTO
    {
        CustomerID = c.CustomerID,
        Name = c.Name
    })
    .FirstOrDefault();
			
context.Customers.DeleteByKey(customerDTO);
```

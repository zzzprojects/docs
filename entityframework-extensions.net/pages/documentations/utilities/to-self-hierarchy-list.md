# ToSelfHierarchyList

## Description

The `ToSelfHierarchyList` method extends your Entity Framework `DbContext` to let you easily include a self hierarchy relationship.

```csharp
var employees = context.Employees.Where(x => x.Name.StartsWith("Employee_"))
	.ToSelfHierarchyList(x => x.Boss);
```

## Real Life Scenarios

- [Include boss, and add them in the returned list](#include-boss-and-add-them-in-the-returned-list)
- [Include boss, and filter them](#include-boss-and-filter-them)
- [Include boss, but only direct one](#include-boss-but-only-direct-one)
- [Include boss, but with custom mapping](#include-boss-but-with-custom-mapping)
- [Include boss, but with an inverse navigation](#include-boss-but-with-an-inverse-navigation)

### Include boss, and add them in the returned list
Like the `Include` method, by default, the entity from the hierarchy is materialized but not part of the returned list.

The option `FlatListRecursionLevel` lets you include boss in the returned list. Use `Int.MaxValue` to return all levels.
- `FlatListRecursionLevel = 0`: will return employee only.
- `FlatListRecursionLevel = 1`: will return employee with direct boss.
- `FlatListRecursionLevel = 2`: will return employee with direct boss and their boss.

```csharp
var employees = context.Employees.Where(x => x.Name.StartsWith("Employee_"))
	.ToSelfHierarchyList(x => x.Boss, 
		options => options.FlatListRecursionLevel = 1);
```

### Include boss, and filter them
The employee can be filtered as you normally do within Entity Framework. 

The `SelfHierarchyQuery` option lets you filter the query that retrieves boss.

```csharp
// The "Boss_2" will not be retrieved
var employees = context.Employees.Where(x => x.Name.StartsWith("Employee_"))
	.ToSelfHierarchyList(x => x.Boss, options => 
		options.SelfHierarchyQuery = q => q.Where(x => !x.Name.Contains("2")));
```

### Include boss, but only direct one
By default, the library makes 10 recursions when retrieving the boss hierarchy.

The `MaxRecursion` option lets you limit the number of recursions. By specifying a `MaxRecursion = 1`, you only retrieve direct boss of your employee.

```csharp
// The CEO will not be retrieved
var employees = context.Employees.Where(x => x.Name.StartsWith("Employee_"))
	.ToSelfHierarchyList(x => x.Boss, options => 
		options.MaxRecursion = 1);
```

### Include boss, but with custom mapping
If your entity doesn't have a navigation property to the boss or employee, it's impossible to use the join expression.

The `ColumnMappings` option lets you specify the mapping yourself. Careful, the column name and not the property name must be used.

```csharp
var employees = context.Employees.Where(x => x.Name.StartsWith("Employee_"))
	.ToSelfHierarchyList(null, options => {
		options.ColumnMappings.Add("BossID", "EmployeeID");
		options.FlatListRecursionLevel = int.MaxValue;
	});
```
[Try it](https://dotnetfiddle.net/8f8bRZ)

### Include boss, but with an inverse navigation
If your entity has only a reference to a list of employees and no navigation property to the boss, it's impossible to use the `JoinExpression` to include the boss.

The `InverseMapping` option lets you specify a join expression to the employee but invert it. So, instead of retrieving their employees, you will retrieve the boss.

```csharp
var employees = context.Employees.Where(x => x.Name.StartsWith("Employee_"))
	.ToSelfHierarchyList(x => x.Employees, options => {
		options.InverseMapping = true;
		options.FlatListRecursionLevel = int.MaxValue;
	});
```

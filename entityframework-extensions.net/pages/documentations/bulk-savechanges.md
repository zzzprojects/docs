# Bulk SaveChanges /n Supercharge your EF Core SaveChanges by adding 'Bulk'

The `BulkSaveChanges` method works like EF Coreâ€™s [SaveChanges](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/saving/basic) methodâ€”only faster! It saves to the database all entities in your [ChangeTracker](https://www.learnentityframeworkcore.com/dbcontext/change-tracker) that have one of the following states: **Added**, **Modified**, or **Deleted**.

```csharp
// @nuget: Z.EntityFramework.Extensions.EFCore
using Z.EntityFramework.Extensions;

// Easy to use
context.BulkSaveChanges();

// Easy to customize
context.BulkSaveChanges(options => options.BatchSize = 100);
```

ðŸ’¡ **One key difference:** If you provide an explicit identity value, you still need to use the `InsertKeepIdentity = true` option to tell our library to keep it.

### Performance Comparison

| Operations       | 1,000 Entities | 2,000 Entities | 5,000 Entities |
| :--------------- | -------------: | -------------: | -------------: |
| SaveChanges      | 1,200 ms       | 2,400 ms       | 6,000 ms       |
| BulkSaveChanges  | 150 ms         | 225 ms         | 500 ms         |

### FAQ

#### Why BulkSaveChanges is faster than SaveChanges?
The `SaveChanges` method makes it quite slow/impossible to handle a scenario that requires to save a lot of entities due to the number of database round-trips required. The `SaveChanges` performs one database round-trip for every entity to insert. So, if you need to insert 10,000 entities, 10,000 database round-trips will be performed which is **INSANELY** slow.

The `BulkSaveChanges` in counterpart requires the minimum number of database round-trips possible. By using Bulk Operations, fewer commands are executed which lead to better performance.

### Why BulkSaveChanges update all columns by default (EF6 only)?
The `BulkSaveChanges` tries to combine most commands in a single operation. Updating different columns from an action to another will require generating different SQL and being executed in several database round-trips.

That's still possible to have the same behavior of `SaveChanges` by disabling the option `ForceUpdateUnmodifiedValues`:

```csharp
ctx.BulkSaveChanges(options => options.ForceUpdateUnmodifiedValues = false);
```

For `EF Core`, this option is not available. Only columns that have a modification will be saved exactly like `SaveChanges`.

#### When should I use BulkSaveChanges over SaveChanges?
Whenever you have more than one entity to save. The `BulkSaveChanges` is almost as fast as the `SaveChanges` for one entity, but becomes way faster as the number of entities to save grows.

#### When should I use BulkSaveChanges over BatchSaveChanges?
`BatchSaveChanges` become slower and slower in comparison to `BulkSaveChanges` when the number of entities to save grows due to the `ChangeTracker`.

After a few thousands of entities, we recommend using `BulkSaveChanges` which is a more scalable solution.

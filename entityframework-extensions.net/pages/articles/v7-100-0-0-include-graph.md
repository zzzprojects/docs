# v7.100.0.0 Breaking Changes: IncludeGraph 

Starting with `v7.100.0.0`, the [IncludeGraph](/include-graph) for EF Core has been entirely rewritten, bringing about the following enhancements:

1. **Reduce Memory Consumption**: The new `IncludeGraph` can reduce memory usage to around **20% of the memory** its predecessor required, or even less.
2. **Improve Performance**: The new `IncludeGraph` can be up to **5 times faster**, and potentially more so when dealing with a very high number of entities.
3. **Elimination of Context Factory**: The new `IncludeGraph` no longer necessitates the configuration of a [Context Factory](/context-factory) for contexts that lack an empty constructor.

Projects that frequently use bulk operations will see additional benefits, as the memory collector now has fewer objects to dispose of, leading to an even greater reduction in memory footprint.

However, it's crucial to be aware that the new `IncludeGraph` comes with some [breaking changes](#breaking-changes), detailed later in this document.

**IMPORTANT**: For those using `IncludeGraph` in their applications, we strongly advise thorough testing before updating your production environment.

## LegacyIncludeGraph

For those who prefer the original `IncludeGraph` functionality from versions prior to `v7.100.0.0`, or encounter issues with the new version, the previous `IncludeGraph` has been renamed to `LegacyIncludeGraph`:

```csharp
context.BulkInsert(list, options => {
	options.LegacyIncludeGraph = true;
});
```

**NOTE**: Please ensure that you do not enable both `IncludeGraph = true` and `LegacyIncludeGraph = true` within the same bulk method. Opt for one or the other.

## Memory & Performance Improvements

The revamped `IncludeGraph` offers a substantial reduction in memory consumption and significant performance enhancements across various scenarios.

These improvements are primarily due to minimizing the dependence of our library on certain EF Core methods. For instance, the `LegacyIncludeGraph` was generating commands similarly to the `SaveChanges` method, but the new `IncludeGraph` has been redesigned to generate commands in a more optimized manner. By reducing the number of commands generated, we've significantly reduced the memory footprint and simultaneously enhanced performance.

To demonstrate, consider a scenario with 2000 invoices and 10,000 invoice items:

- [IncludeGraph Demo](https://dotnetfiddle.net/ImBJ1x)
- [LegacyIncludeGraph Demo](https://dotnetfiddle.net/HG7L9q)
- [Without Saving](https://dotnetfiddle.net/yOBjBV)

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zzzprojects/docs/master/entityframework-extensions.net/images/include-graph-memory-performance-comparisons.png" alt="Memory & Performance Comparisons" loading="lazy">

Though the improvement might seem marginal initially, the new `IncludeGraph` takes **94 MB**, while the `LegacyIncludeGraph` takes **128 MB**. However, if we remove the **70MB** required to create the context and entities but not related to this option, it means that the `IncludeGraph` takes only **24 MB** while the `LegacyIncludeGraph` takes **58 MB**. So the new `IncludeGraph` took only **40%** of the memory compared to `LegacyIncludeGraph` and the difference becomes even more noticeable as the number of entities rises.

In addition, the improvement in the performance was twice as fast which is another benefit of the new `IncludeGraph`.

Due to .NET Fiddle's memory constraints, we cannot showcase examples with a larger number of entities online. However, based on our tests, here's what you can expect:

**10k invoices, 50k InvoiceItem**:

| | IncludeGraph | LegacyIncludeGraph | SaveChanges |
| -- | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Memory | 60 MB | 220 MB | 200 MB |
| Performance | 1.5s | 5s | 6s |

**100k invoices, 500k InvoiceItem**:

| | IncludeGraph | LegacyIncludeGraph | SaveChanges |
| -- | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Memory | 400 MB | 2000 MB | 1800 MB |
| Performance | 10s | 48s | 58s |

From these observations, the `LegacyIncludeGraph` consumes marginally more memory compared to `SaveChanges`, but offers better performance.

The new `IncludeGraph` consumes around **20% of the memory** that its predecessor did and can perform bulk operations **5 times faster**. This memory savings can be even more significant in projects that often use bulk operations, as the garbage collector now has fewer objects to manage.

- Does not yet support [Entity Splitting](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/modeling/table-splitting#entity-splitting)

## Breaking Changes

### Default Value Handling

The **primary breaking change** in the new `IncludeGraph` relates to the handling of default values.

Consider the following example:

```csharp
public static void Main()
{
	List<Customer> customers = new List<Customer>();
	customers.Add(new Customer { Name = "ZZZ Projects", MaximumRequestPerDay = 100 });
	customers.Add(new Customer { Name = "Jonathan Magnan" });
}

public class EntityContext : DbContext
{
	protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
	{
		modelBuilder.Entity<Customer>().Property(x => x.MaximumRequestPerDay).HasDefaultValueSql("50");
		base.OnModelCreating(modelBuilder);
	}
	
	public DbSet<Customer> Customers { get; set; }
}

public class Customer
{
	public int CustomerID { get; set; }
	public string Name { get; set; }
	public int MaximumRequestPerDay { get; set; }
}
```

In this example, we've set a default SQL value (`50`) for the `MaximumRequestPerDay` property of the `Customer` class. For the customer **ZZZ Projects**, we have set the `MaximumRequestPerDay` value to `100`, and for the customer **Jonathan Magnan**, we have not specified any value for the `MaximumRequestPerDay` property.

When the model is aware of a SQL default value, a method like `BulkInsert(customers)` will ignore the `MaximumRequestPerDay` property during insertion, regardless of whether a value has been specified. It will always let the database use the default value.

With the `LegacyIncludeGraph` option, the behavior was different. This option relied on EF Core to generate commands, which already handled this scenario perfectly by treating the two entities as two separate inserts as they have different behavior. Which means, that an insert will be used for entities that have a value specified (**ZZZ Projects** have the value `100`), and an insert is created for entities that have no value that will ignore the `MaximumRequestPerDay` property (***Jonathan Magnan** have no value specified).  However, this came at the cost of greater memory consumption and reduced performance.

The new `IncludeGraph` option now generates the command itself, behaving the same way as when no option is specified. This means it will ignore the `MaximumRequestPerDay` property during insertion, regardless of whether a value has been provided.

To force the use of values from the entity, you can utilize the [ForceValueGeneratedStrategy](/forcevaluegeneratedstrategy) option:

```csharp
context.BulkInsert(list, options => {
	options.IncludeGraph = true;
	
	// if you want all types to use the same strategy
	// options.ForceValueGeneratedStrategy = Z.EntityFramework.Extensions.ValueGeneratedStrategyType.OnAdd;
	
	options.IncludeGraphOperationBuilder = builder =>
	{
		if(builder is Z.BulkOperations.BulkOperation<Customer> bulk)
		{
			// if you want specific type to use this strategy
			bulk.ForceValueGeneratedStrategy = Z.EntityFramework.Extensions.ValueGeneratedStrategyType.OnAdd;
		}
	};
});
```

If your insert requires both behaviors, we recommend continuing to use the `LegacyIncludeGraph` option.

For a clearer understanding, examine the following examples and their outputs:
- [DefaultValueSql + Without Options](https://dotnetfiddle.net/4KCxfD)
- [DefaultValueSql + LegacyIncludeGraph](https://dotnetfiddle.net/yZA1RR)
- [DefaultValueSql + IncludeGraph](https://dotnetfiddle.net/yBfHSD)
- [DefaultValueSql + IncludeGraph + ValueGeneratedStrategyType.OnAdd](https://dotnetfiddle.net/F2nu0I)


### Handling Duplicate Entities in a List

Consider the following example:

```csharp
public class Customer
{
    public int CustomerID { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
}

List<Customer> customers = new List<Customer>();

var duplicate = new Customer { Name = "ZZZ Projects" };

// Add it twice
customers.Add(duplicate);
customers.Add(duplicate);
```

In this case, the same customer has been added twice to the `customers` list. Depending on how you use `BulkInsert`, different behaviors will manifest:

- **BulkInsert**: The same customer will be inserted twice.
- **BulkInsert + IncludeGraph**: An exception will be thrown. Duplicate entities are not permitted with the new `IncludeGraph`.
- **BulkInsert + LegacyIncludeGraph**: The customer will only be inserted once. The graph identifies the entity as identical within the list and prevents duplicate insertions.

The behavior described above for [IncludeGraph](/include-graph) applies only to the top-level entity (`Customer`). Any entities found within the graph will be added only once if they are the same instance.

### Handling Duplicate Key on Root

Consider the following example:

```csharp
public class Customer
{
    public int CustomerID { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
}

List<Customer> customers = new List<Customer>();

customers.Add(new Customer { CustomerID = 1, Name = "ZZZ Projects" });
customers.Add(new Customer { CustomerID = 1, Name = "Jonathan Magnan" });
```

In this scenario, different customers have been added, but they share the same key in the `customers` list. Depending on your `BulkInsert` configuration, different behaviors will emerge:

- **BulkInsert**: SQL Server will throw the error: 'Violation of PRIMARY KEY constraint 'PK_Customers'. Cannot insert duplicate key in object 'dbo.Customers'. The duplicate key value is (1).'
- **BulkInsert + IncludeGraph**: SQL Server will throw the error: 'Violation of PRIMARY KEY constraint 'PK_Customers'. Cannot insert duplicate key in object 'dbo.Customers'. The duplicate key value is (1).'
- **BulkInsert + LegacyIncludeGraph**: The EF Core tracking will throw the error: 'The instance of entity type 'Customer' cannot be tracked because another instance with the same key value for {'CustomerID'} is already being tracked'

### Handling Duplicate Key in Graph

Consider the following example:

```csharp
public class Invoice
{
	public int ID { get; set; }
	public int ColumnInt { get; set; }
	public InvoiceItem Item1 { get; set; }
	public InvoiceItem Item2 { get; set; }
}

public class InvoiceItem
{
	public int ID { get; set; }
	public int ColumnInt { get; set; }
}

var invoice = new Invoice() { ColumnInt = 1 };

var itemX = new InvoiceItem() { ID = 1, ColumnInt = 2 };
var itemY = new InvoiceItem() { ID = 1, ColumnInt = 3 };

invoice.Item1 = itemX;
invoice.Item2 = itemY;
```

In this scenario, the invoice has been added with 2 different `InvoiceItem` objects that have the same `ID`.

Due to how `context.Add(invoice);` functions, the `ChangeTracker` will update `Item2` to overwrite its value with `ItemX`. In more detail:

- The `ChangeTracker` adds the `invoice` for tracking.
- When adding `itemX`, the `ChangeTracker` checks if an `InvoiceItem` already exists with this key. Since the answer is `no`, it adds it for tracking.
- When adding `itemY`, the `ChangeTracker` checks if an `InvoiceItem` already exists with this key. Since the answer is `yes`, it updates the reference of `Item2` to `itemX`.

In this situation, different behaviors will occur:

- **SaveChanges**: The invoice and `itemX` will be inserted. The `itemY` will not be saved.
- **BulkSaveChanges**: The invoice and `itemX` will be inserted. The `itemY` will not be saved. This follows the same behavior as `SaveChanges`.
- **BulkInsert + IncludeGraph**: SQL Server will show the error: 'Violation of PRIMARY KEY constraint 'PK_InvoiceItems'. Cannot insert duplicate key in object 'dbo.InvoiceItems'. The duplicate key value is (1).'
- **BulkInsert + LegacyIncludeGraph**: The invoice and `itemX` will be inserted. This follows the same behavior as `SaveChanges`.

For `BulkInsert`, we assumed that the `ID` is always inserted or the option `InsertKeepIdentity` is true.

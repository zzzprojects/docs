title: What database providers are supported in Dapper?
---

Dapper supports a wide range of database providers that are compatible with ADO.NET, including but not limited to Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQLite.

Since Dapper has no database-specific implementation, it works with pretty much all providers.

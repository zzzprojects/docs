title: What database providers is supported in Dapper?
---

Dapper supports a wide range of database providers that are compatible with ADO.NET, including but not limited to Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQLite.

Since Dapper has no database specific implementation, it works with pretty much all providers.

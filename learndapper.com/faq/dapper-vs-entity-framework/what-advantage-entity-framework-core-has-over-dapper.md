- **Fully Featured ORM**: EF Core provides a rich set of features such as lazy loading, change tracking, migrations, and more.
- **Database Abstraction**: EF Core abstracts the database system, allowing you to switch between different databases with minimal code changes.
- **Code First Development**: EF Core supports code first approach, where you define your database structure using C# classes.
- **Migration**: EF Core includes support for data migrations, allowing for database schema changes directly from the code.
- **LINQ Support**: With EF Core, you can use Language Integrated Query (LINQ) to build queries in C#, leading to more maintainable and readable code.
- **Change Tracking**: EF Core automatically tracks changes made to your entities and can update the database accordingly, eliminating the need for manual update statements.

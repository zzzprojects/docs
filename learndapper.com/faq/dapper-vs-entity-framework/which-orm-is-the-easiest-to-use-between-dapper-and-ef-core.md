title: Which ORM is the easiest to use between Dapper and EF Core?
---

Both are easy to use when you are familiar with the ORM. 

When starting, Dapper will be easier to use over EF Core as you can quickly understand the API over EF Core.

However, EF Core might be considered easiest to use for those who prefer to work with LINQ and higher-level abstractions.

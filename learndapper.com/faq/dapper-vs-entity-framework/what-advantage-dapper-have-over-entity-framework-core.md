- **Performance**: Dapper is typically more performant than EF Core due to its lightweight nature and lack of overhead.
- **Control over SQL Queries**: With Dapper, you have full control over your SQL queries, which can lead to more optimized database operations.
- **Simplicity**: Dapper's simple and straightforward design makes it easier to learn and use, especially for developers already comfortable with SQL.
- **Efficient Data Reader Mapping**: Dapper enables efficient mapping from a .NET data reader to a specific object model.
- **Flexibility with Stored Procedures**: Dapper works seamlessly with stored procedures, unlike EF Core which can impose certain conventions.

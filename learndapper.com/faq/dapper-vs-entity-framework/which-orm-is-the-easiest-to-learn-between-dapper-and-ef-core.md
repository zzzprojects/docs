title: Which ORM is the easiest to learn between Dapper and EF Core?
---

Dapper is easier to learn. As a micro-ORM, it has fewer features and a more straightforward API, resulting in a rapid learning curve. However, Dapper also requires developers to write raw SQL queries, which might be an additional thing to learn if you are unfamiliar with SQL.

On the other hand, EF Core is harder to learn but provides many advanced features and abstractions. On the plus side, you don't have to learn SQL, which can make learning easier for people with only a little SQL knowledge.
